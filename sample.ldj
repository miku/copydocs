The Business Software Alliance (BSA) and International Data Corporation (IDC) estimated that worldwide software piracy rate went up to 41 percent in 2008 and worldwide losses to software vendors due to software piracy totaled more than $50 billion in 2008 (BSA and IDC, 2009). Besides being an economic problem, software piracy is also an ethical issue, especially in academic settings. The evidences from numerous studies suggest that many undergraduate students consider software piracy and other unethical use of information technologies as an acceptable behavior.\n The main purpose of the present study is to investigate the relationships between the demographic characteristics of freshman students and their attitudes towards software piracy. Data were obtained from a survey sample of 125 students in the Department of Business Administration at a public university in Turkey. The study found that overall attitudes of freshman students towards software piracy are close to neutral position on the Likert scale. The results of the regression analysis showed that monthly family income and duration of Internet usage in a week affected attitudes of freshman students towards software piracy, but to a lower extent. \n In order to minimize software piracy among university students, proactive steps should be taken. Education is one of the most common recommendations in the literature for preventing software piracy and raising awareness of software piracy among students. Education on ethical topics and information technology use should include ethical use of information technologies and software in the curriculum and should be supported by the real case studies.

Although positive and significant, our estimated elasticities are essentially zero: a 10% increase in clicks on illegal downloading websites leads to a 0.2% increase in clicks on legal purchases websites. Online music streaming services are found to have a somewhat larger (but still small) effect on the purchases of digital sound recordings, suggesting complementarities between these two modes of music consumption.

Despite substantial growth in availability, choice sets have not converged across countries; and observers point to copyright-related transaction costs as an obstacle to greater availability. Policy makers are now contemplating various copyright reforms that could reduce these trade costs. The possibility of these changes raises the question of how much benefit they would create for consumers and producers around the world. We address these questions with a structural model of supply and demand for music in 17 countries, which we employ to counterfactually simulate the effect of a European digital single market (the equivalent of a pan-European copyright regime) on the welfare of consumers and producers. We also simulate autarky and worldwide frictionless trade - in which all products are available in all countries - allowing us to quantify both the conventional gains from status quo trade as well as the maximum possible gains available to free trade. Existing and additional trade have different patterns of benefit to consumers and producers. Status quo trade benefits consumers everywhere, but European consumers have benefited more than North Americans. Existing trade has had large benefits to American producers but on balance small benefits to European producers. Additional trade would continue the pattern of consumers benefits with larger gains to European consumers but would reverse the pattern for producers. Greater availability of products resulting from easing of copyright restrictions would raise per capita gains to producers in Europe more than in North America. Finally, we find that a European single market would bring most of the benefits of worldwide frictionless trade to both consumers and producers alike. \n Moving from the current status quo to an EU Digital Single Market for music would increase consumer surplus from digital music consumption by 1.8 per cent (\u20ac19 million) and music producers' revenue by 1.1 per cent (\u20ac10 million). Benefits vary considerably across Member States. Under worldwide frictionless trade consumers in 15 European countries gain \u20ac31 million (a 3% increase) while North American consumers gain \u20ac6.5 million (a 0.35% increase). Most of the gains from fully frictionless trade - about two thirds - are accomplished by a European single market. Annual gains from worldwide frictionless trade for producers, compared to autarky, reach 1.9% in Europe and 0.38% in the US. Clearly, the additional gains from moving beyond a European Digital Single Market to a worldwide open market would be small for European producers and consumers.

Thus, it is proposed that, in the short term, with the help of the empirical findings and recommendations of this study, the EC Commission submits a proposal for two amendment of Article 6(4) of the Information Society Directive, as follows:\n(1) A definition of the expression \u2018appropriate measures\u2019 should be inserted in Article 6(4) of the Information Society Directive, stating that for the purposes of that Directive such measures require the establishment of a procedure to enable expeditious access to works by beneficiaries of privileged exceptions, leading to the creation of standardized access to works portals across EC Member States.\nThe existence of access to works portals would be made possible by a DRM deposit system, according to which the means to enable beneficiaries of privileged exceptions to benefit from them would be deposited and made available through access to works portals, in specified circumstances.\n(2) It should be added to Article 6(4) of the Information Society Directive that where access to works by beneficiaries of privileged exceptions is not facilitated, the protection of privileged exceptions (given their connection to core freedoms) prevails over the protection of DRM, even where works are supplied online on agreed contractual terms. \n This study, by questionnaires and interviews, found some organisations and individuals who are beneficiaries of  privileged exceptions are adversely affected by DRM. In order to ensure that legally privileged exceptions (e.g., for librarians, lecturers, and students) to copyright can be exercised, amendments to the Information Society Directive are recommended. \n Article 6(4) of the Information Society Directive should be amended as follows:\n (1) A definition of the expression \u2018appropriate measures\u2019 should be inserted in Article 6(4) of the Information Society Directive, stating that for the purposes of that Directive such measures require the establishment of a procedure to enable expeditious access to works by beneficiaries of privileged exceptions, leading to the creation of standardized access to works portals across EC Member States.

According to Business Software Alliance (2008), over 41% of the PC software packages installed worldwide were unauthorized copies. Software piracy behavior has been investigated for more than 30 years. However, after a review of the relevant literature, there appears to be two voids in this literature: a lack of studies in non-Western countries and a scarcity of process studies. This study contributes to literature by developing a software piracy model to better understand the decision-making process that underlies this unethical behavior. The model was tested using data collected from a sample of 323 undergraduate business students. Consistent with the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA), attitudes toward software piracy and subjective norms were significant predictors of intention to pirate software. Also, the results suggested that ethical ideology, public self-consciousness, and low self-control moderated the effect of these variables on intention to pirate software. The results have important practical implications for the software industry and governments hoping to curtail software piracy.

Analyses of the final reports indicate that there is a vast and inconsistent array of actions and underlying feelings toward digital music downloading. The findings reveal inconsistencies between participants\u2019 recommendations (what the subject should do) and their attitudes and opinions on the matter (what they would do in a similar situation). These inconsistencies support the notion that as technology evolves, it creates discrepancies between the way things are and the way the law expects them to be, leaving society in a muddle, trying to reconcile the two. What remains to be seen is whether the discrepancy in the case of music downloading becomes extreme enough that the law changes to accommodate an increasingly prevalent behavior, or whether new business models will emerge to bridge the gap between legality and reality. \n The following study is an investigation into what is occurring in society\u2019s collective mind as it continues to download digital music.

However, close examination of the EU Term Directive\u2019s intricate provisions reveals a piecemeal and permissive approach to harmonisation which preserves many differences between the national rules. In this report, four main sources of legislative variability are identified and analysed: a) contagion from unharmonised areas of substantive copyright law; b) explicit exceptions to the harmonisation of the term of protection; c) national related rights of unharmonised term; and d) incorrect implementation of the provisions of the Term Directive into national law. As a result, the desired harmonising effect has not been fully achieved: although a single rule may be applicable across the EU in theory, drastically divergent terms of protection may attach to the same information product depending on the jurisdiction within which protection is sought. In this way, the territorial nature of copyright undercuts harmonisation efforts, forcing the public domain to contract and expand according to divergent national rules. The result is a legislative framework that makes cross-border rights clearance calculation difficult, hampering end-users and cultural heritage organisations from taking full avail of the new opportunities now technically available for the digitisation and exploitation of the public domain. If the EU wishes to establish a truly harmonised term of protection for copyright and related rights, a more committed and comprehensive approach will be a necessary. \n The author points out that if the public domain is to be fully and freely digitised and exploited legal certainly must be provided as to exactly which cultural creations fall within its confines and which are still protected by proprietary rights. The semi-harmonisation achieved thus far has narrowed the autonomy of Member States in the area of the term of protection, providing some superficial approximation. The devil of disharmonisation however persists in the details of term harmonisation. If the EU wishes to establish a truly harmonised term of protection for copyright and related rights, a more committed and comprehensive approach will be a necessary. Some of the identified harmonisation gaps can be filled with a stricter European harmonisation policy intolerant of national oddities. Others, such as those caused by transitional provisions or international obligations granting terms of protection longer than those foreseen in the Directive, will not be eliminated for decades. However, disparities in the conceptual framework of copyright can only be overcome with the harmonisation of European substantive copyright law. In its recent Communication on a Single Market for Intellectual Property Rights the Commission broached the idea of a far-reaching overhaul of copyright at the European level through the creation of a European Copyright Code.

Thus, it is highly possible that the activity of\ndojinshi  creators violates Article 28 of the Copyright Law of Japan, which states the rights of original authors in the situation of exploitation by derivative works. We demonstrate that ignoring copyright infringement by a derivative creator can be optimal for the copyright holder based on an economic model that incorporates both positive and negative externalities of derivative work.

While in recent years distinct aspects of the problem have been addressed by legislatures and courts, both at the national and at the European level, a great deal of legal uncertainty persists. Divergent views on the appropriateness, form and scope of such legal protection exist among stakeholders and other concerned parties, reflecting the complex nature and multiple functions of sports in modern society. The universe of sports and media is a complex network of social and commercial relationships with a variety of stakeholders, each one of whom can claim rights or specific interests in the value chain of organizing and exploiting sports events, such as clubs, leagues, athletes, federations, fans, media content providers, sponsors, owners of sport facilities, sports betting operators and news media.  \n Consequently, the question of protecting sports events is by no means a one-dimensional legal issue, and should be framed in a broader socio-economic context. On the one hand, professional sport represents a large and fast-growing sector of the European economy \u2013 and in no small measure this is due to the commercial significance of sports media rights. On the other hand, sports are widely regarded as playing a pivotal role as a \u201csocial cohesive\u201d, an agent of communal, and conveyor of moral, values. This helps explain why major sports events qualify in various Member States as \u201cevents of major importance\u201d for society, subject to special media rules mitigating exclusive rights of broadcasters to guarantee viewers\u2019 access to these events via free-to-air television.  \n The general objective of this study is to examine and critically assess a number of the most pressing questions of substantive law relating to the existence and exercise of sports organisers' rights in the EU. The specific objectives of the study are:  \n\uf0b7 To map the legal framework applicable to the origin and ownership of sports organisers' rights in the 28 Member States; \uf0b7 To analyse the nature and scope of sports organisers' rights with regard to licensing practices in the field of the media, taking into account relevant EU law provisions; \uf0b7 To examine the possibility of establishing licensing practices beyond the media field, notably in the area of gambling and betting; \uf0b7 To provide recommendations on the opportunity of EU action to address any problem that may be identified in the above mentioned areas of analysis. \n 1. actively prosecutes illegal betting services (including the offering of sports bets by licensed operators without the sports organisers\u2019 consent); 2. monitors the commercial exploitation of the right to consent to bets to prevent discriminatory or anti-competitive marketing conditions; 3. provides for an ex post mechanism for complaint handling and dispute resolution; 4. has the power to conduct on-going monitoring of the parties\u2019 compliance with the mutual rights and obligations contained in the contractual agreements. \n The EU should encourage Member States to address the generally observed lack of legal certainty as regards sports sponsorship by gambling operators in the context of their national gambling advertising regulations.  It is recommended that sponsorship-related issues are included in the European Commission\u2019s upcoming \u201cRecommendation on responsible gambling advertising\u201d. Other additional courses of action ought to be considered, in particular to facilitate enforcement co-operation between different national regulatory authorities concerning cross-border advertising of unauthorized gambling services.  \n Regarding cross-border sports events, further attention should be paid to the use of technological tools that may offer pragmatic solutions (e.g. virtual advertising). In any event, organisers of such events must respect national legislations. In case they induce participants in their events to infringe national gambling advertising and/or breach personal sponsorship contracts, they should arguably be found liable and not the participant that is faced with a dilemma: respect the regulations of the sports organiser (that typically require participants to comply with the organisers\u2019 sponsorship arrangements) or respect national regulations and personal sponsorship contracts with the risk of being eliminated from the competition.", "implications": "The EU should encourage Member States to address the generally observed lack of legal certainty as regards sports sponsorship by gambling operators in the context of their national gambling advertising regulations.

The main issues discussed are the impact of selection on access, the preservation of original material and digital objects, and the financial issues surrounding digitization projects. The article does not deal with the technical aspects of digitization. A questionnaire survey was conducted of 20 UK public libraries and archives to determine their experiences related to the above issues. It was found that few digitization projects realized their full potential in terms of preserving original material, and so little has been done to ensure the preservation of the digitized material. Although access is significantly increased, the range of material that has been digitized is very narrow and is driven largely by copyright restrictions rather than user demand. The survey also highlighted the disparity between funding for access to a very small portion of library holdings through digitization, and the funding of traditional preservation for the remainder of collections. \n The opinion amongst those surveyed is very much that funding sources for digitization and for preservation are distinctly separate, and therefore one does not affect the other.\nHowever comments made by the respondents verified that tensions do exist over the levels of funding available for each activity. The survey highlighted just how little is spent on\npreservation in many libraries and archives and that typically preservation needs are seen as much larger than budgets can cater for.\nAlthough the data on financial issues was far from comprehensive, this in itself tends to indicate a general lack of awareness concerning project costs. However, having allowed for the incomplete nature of the data, two points are tentatively made. The impact of major grant\nfunding has been to virtually halt digitization projects in public libraries and archives during the last two years, and the majority of digitization projects have generated no significant\nrevenue.\nThe widespread promotion of preservation (after access) as a major benefit following digitization does not appear to be widely supported by the subsequent actions in public libraries and archives. The two ways in which digitization is said to improve preservation, a fall in demand\nto see original material and the imposition of access restrictions, have not been universally seen or adopted.\nThe level of awareness that libraries and archives in general have concerning the problems of digital preservation, must have risen to some degree given their exposure to the standards in the nof-digitise programme. However, libraries and archives have been slow to adopt preservation\npolicies and none of those surveyed include digitization in their policy.\nThere is also a distinct lack of urgency in considering migration as a strategy for digital preservation. The comments of respondents indicated that this was more likely to be an issue for the IT department to consider, although the majority of libraries and archives claimed sole responsibility for the preservation of digital master files. \n Digitization projects are complex and need to be managed carefully to ensure resources are not wasted. Libraries and archives must budget for the whole life cycle of the digitization process and not just for image capture.\nThe survey has shown that following digitization, demand for access to original material does not necessarily\ndecline. Libraries and archives should consider automatically placing restrictions on access to original materials where appropriate. This would improve preservation at little cost to the beleaguered budgets identified by many respondents, and would be consistent with using preservation as a selection criterion.\nUntil a formal preservation policy is in place, any attempt to raise significant funding for preservation activities is unlikely to succeed. Having a preservation policy is now a common requisite for the consideration of applications by funding bodies.\nDigitization should be included in that policy, even if no projects are currently planned. It will help increase awareness of digital preservation issues and will highlight the preservation aspects of digitization, rather than those that exclusively concern access.\nResearch is needed into how strategies for acquiring and preserving digital material can be developed specifically for the public library sector as a whole.

The review included a call for interested party submissions and intergovernmental agency consultations.\nCopyright is a form of intellectual property that protects the rights of creators in certain original forms of expression, including photographs and cinematograph films. It rewards creative effort, and economic investment in creative effort, by granting a number of exclusive economic rights. These rights provide an incentive to encourage the generation and flow of new material to the public. One of the core rights granted by copyright is the right to prevent other persons from copying a work. While copyright does not guarantee a proportionate return for the work involved, the ability to require other persons to pay for copying can give creators and investors some security for the skill, time and resources necessary to produce new works.\nThe Act also provides many exceptions which limit the scope of copyright. These exceptions are an integral part of copyright, recognising that in some circumstances the usual rights of copyright owners should not apply. Exceptions may be adopted for various reasons; such as to permit incidental uses that do not cause significant harm to copyright owners or because a particular limitation of copyright serves the broader public interest. The nature and scope of exceptions reflect decisions by Parliament on balancing public and private interests. \n The Department recommended no statutory changes at the time of the Report other than increased public information and education.", "implications": "The Department recommended no statutory changes at the time of the Report other than increased public information and education.", "results": "The Department recommended no statutory changes at the time of the Report other than increased public information and education."}}

Fair use, an exotic and occasional feature of documentary film in 2004, has become well-known and commonly employed. Creative options for filmmakers concerning use of third-party material have dramatically improved with changes in norms after the issuing of the Statement. Attitudes about fair use are strongly associated with free expression and creative opportunity, and vary with experience. Where filmmakers have changed work because of copyright concerns, they themselves rather than any gatekeeper have made the decision to do so. Where change is associated with fair use, risk is a common concern. Newer filmmakers are more likely to support use of copyrighted material to make new work, but less likely to know about fair use, and also more likely to have experienced takedowns online. Both education about and experience with fair use appear to have an effect on practice.

The Report makes a number of recommendations, the overall effect of which will be a more flexible and adaptive copyright framework. The reforms will enhance access to cultural material, without undermining incentives to create. The recommended exceptions are also intended to be more consistent with public standards of fairness.\nThe Terms of Reference for this Inquiry focus on exceptions to copyright law. Exceptions allow certain uses of copyright material that would otherwise be infringements of copyright. Stakeholder input has been highly relevant in identifying the focus of investigation for this Inquiry, and not all exceptions have received consideration. The recommendations in this Report are intended to make the Copyright Act more accessible and better suited to the digital environment, but do not attempt overall redrafting or simplification of the legislation. \n The introduction of fair use will mean Australian copyright law can be applied to new technologies and new commercial and consumer practices, without constant recourse to legislative change. Fair use will promote innovation and enable a market-based response to the demands of the digital age.\n The ALRC considers that exceptions to copyright, whether in the form of a specific rule or a general standard, should only permit the unlicensed use of copyright material where this would be fair.

Using a combination of propensity-score weighting and difference-in-differences estimation strategies, we find that HHMI investigators produce high-impact articles at a much higher rate than a control group of similarly accomplished NIH-funded scientists.

Despite having this large body of evidence before it, the jury is required to answer the question of substantial similarity through a mere comparison of the two works.

When provided with additional information about the simple fact of copying, or about the amount of creative effort that went into the protected work, we saw an appreciable variation (i.e., upwards) in subjects\u2019 assessments of similarity between the works, suggesting that fact-finders are sensitive to additional information about the two works and the creators who produced them, contrary to what current law assumes.

The survey was designed to inform Industry Canada's policy development work and ultimately therefore support better policy decisions regarding the copyright law in Canada. In order to support its policy decisions regarding the copyright regime in Canada, Industry Canada commissioned a survey by Decima Research in 2006 which was designed to measure the extent to which peer to peer (P2P) file-sharing activities act as substitutes or complements to music purchases. Given this purpose the Decima survey asked respondents to comment on their behaviour in the absence of P2P file-sharing, as follows:\n Considering the songs that you downloaded for free through P2P networks during 2005\na) what\u00a0% would you have purchased at paid music sites if they were not available through P2P\nb) what\u00a0% would you have purchased as part of a music CD if they were not available through P2P\n After analyzing the answers to this question, I report on two key findings:\n1. three out of every four respondents said that if P2P were not available they would have purchased some or all of the music which they downloaded; and\n2. almost two-thirds of the hardcore P2P downloaders (those who indicated in the survey that they only acquired music by P2P) said they would have purchased one-third of the tracks they downloaded if the songs were not available on P2P network. This is estimated to amount to an average additional expense of $168 per person, adding up to hundreds of millions of dollars in extra revenue for the music industry per year from this group alone.\n This analysis of survey data then suggests that P2P downloads have strong negative effects on legitimate music purchases and that P2P downloading acts as a substitute for legitimate music purchases.

New game show, casting, soap, telenovela, documentary and other formats are sold to broadcasting stations in dozens of countries, leading to a worldwide multi-billion dollar industry. As an analysis of U.S. and European intellectual property law demonstrates, TV show formats are difficult to protect by intellectual property law. Standard theory would predict that in the absence of intellectual property protection, the TV show format industry has insufficient incentives to invest in creative innovation. This article presents a novel theory to explain why the TV show format market is thriving despite a low level of format protection. On the supply side of the industry, demand for TV show formats is hard to predict, return on them is highly skewed, and market participants are both developing original formats and imitating others\u2019 formats. On the demand side, TV show formats are experience goods, and TV viewers sometimes prefer familiar products. As a result, the TV show format market is subject to herding effects on both sides of the market. The interaction of supply-side and demand-side herding leads to fashion cycles in TV show formats. The industry uses the limited protection against format imitation, but has adapted to the fashion cycle. This article tells the story of how an industry has developed institutions enabling it to cope with uncertain demand and unpredictable profitability, while benefiting from limited appropriability of innovation and from the fashion cycles which underlie the innovative process. It demonstrates the great diversity and flexibility of appropriation strategies in a world of limited and uncertain allocation of property rights. \n This Article has proposed a novel theory to explain how the TV format industry is able to cope with format imitation beyond the limited degree of format protection. Like other media industries, the TV format industry is characterized by supply-side and demand-side herding effects that lead to fashion cycles, which are limited in duration. Unlike other media industries, the TV format industry has developed mechanisms to cope with this situation, without having to rely too much on format protection. Beyond a core protection against close format imitation, format developers and broadcasters, who are often both innovators and imitators, benefit from a regime of free-format appropriability, as this enables them to allocate profitability risk across the industry and to cope with uncertainty of demand. TV formats go in and out of fashion, and the format industry has developed tools to coordinate and ride the fashion cycle. The key to understanding TV format imitation is the cycle that can make an industry thrive beyond the borders of a weak property regime. \n Being successful in a market such as the TV Formats market may not require stronger intellectual property protection. Rather, it requires market participants to figure out smart ways to combine protection and imitation strategies.\nIntellectual property law should be careful not to base its policies on a simple economic account of property rights as a solution to a public goods problem.

Without it, much of our economic and communicative action would constitute copyright infringement.   Yet despite the importance of the fair use defense, and despite the enormous amount of scholarly attention that it has received, we continue to lack any systematic, comprehensive account of our fair use case law and the actual state of our fair use doctrine. Instead, our conventional wisdom derives from a small set of conventionally agreed-upon leading cases. This Article presents the results of the first empirical study of our fair use case law to show that much of our conventional wisdom about that case law is mistaken. Working from a data set consisting of all reported federal opinions that made substantial use of the section 107 four-factor test for fair use through 2005, the Article shows which factors and subfactors actually drive the outcome of the fair use test in practice, how the fair use factors interact, how courts inflect certain individual factors, and the extent to which judges stampede the factor outcomes to conform to the overall test outcome. It also presents empirical evidence of the extent to which lower courts either deliberately ignored or were ignorant of fair use doctrine set forth in the leading cases, particularly those from the Supreme Court. Based on these descriptive findings, the Article prescribes a set of doctrinal practices that will improve courts\u2019 adjudication of the fair use defense. \n - Between 1976 and 2005, federal courts reported 306 opinions, 215 of which made substantial use the four factors of s. 107, which the author notes is a surprisingly small number.\n - The Second and Ninth Circuit reported the highest number of cases and heavily influence other circuits even though the decisions are not directly precedential.\n - The outcome of the case is heavily driven by the fourth factor (commercial use/effect on potential market) and less strongly driven by the first factor (purpose and character).  Factor two (nature of copyrighted work) has no significant impact on outcome.  Factor three (amount and substantiality taken) has minimal impact.\n - The influence of other factors outside of s. 107, such as publication or bad faith, are also discussed as affecting outcome.\n - Judicial decisions have consistently expanded the scope of the fair use defence. \n More consistent and correct application of fair use law; transparency; certainty", "implications": "More consistent and correct application of fair use law; transparency; certainty", "results": "- Between 1976 and 2005, federal courts reported 306 opinions, 215 of which made substantial use the four factors of s. 107, which the author notes is a surprisingly small number.\n - The Second and Ninth Circuit reported the highest number of cases and heavily influence other circuits even though the decisions are not directly precedential.\n - The outcome of the case is heavily driven by the fourth factor (commercial use/effect on potential market) and less strongly driven by the first factor (purpose and character).

Although the emphasis is on the economic analysis, it also briefly presents the legal context and its recent evolution. As digital piracy consists in infringing intellectual property laws, it is important to start by understanding the rationale of such laws. That allows a more precise definition of what is meant by digital piracy. The study then moves on to the economic analysis of piracy, starting with the basic analysis, which explains why piracy is likely to decrease the profits of the producers of digital products; also examined is how the producers have reacted to digital piracy when it started to grow. Next is a review of more recent contributions to the field that point at possible channels through which piracy could improve the profitability of digital products. These channels have inspired new business models for the distribution of digital products, which are described in the last part of the essay. Throughout the essay are reported the results of some of the most recent empirical studies, so as to quantify the impacts of digital piracy.", "implications": "", "results": ""}}

Using data on a sample of undergraduate students, we study the determinants of music piracy by looking at whether a respondent\u2019s last song was obtained illegally or not. In doing so, we incorporate (i) the individual-specific transactions costs that constitute the effective price of illegal music; and (ii) individual willingness to pay (WTP) for digital music, which we elicit using a simple field experiment and which we use to control for the unobserved heterogeneity of preferences between respondents. Our empirical results indicate that a respondent\u2019s subjective probability of facing a lawsuit and her degree of morality both have a negative impact on the likelihood that her last song was obtained illegally. These results are robust whether WTP is estimated parametrically or nonparametrically. We conclude by discussing the practical implications of our findings. \n These findings point to an important policy recommendation.

But complexity makes a difference. Under standard models, development contracts for specialized software may be difficult to write and ownership rights do not necessarily elicit socially optimal effort. I consider three mechanisms that improve the likelihood that firms can obtain the software they need: pre-packaged software, Application Program Interfaces (APIs) and Free/Open Source software (FOSS). I show that with complex software, some firms will choose to participate in FOSS over both \"make or buy\" and this increases social welfare. In general, FOSS complements proprietary provision, rather than replacing it. Pre-packaged software can coexist in the marketplace with FOSS: pre-packaged software addresses common uses with limited feature sets, while firms with specialized, more complex needs use FOSS. \n This analysis may help dispel two myths about F/OSS (Free/Open Source Software):\n Managers need to view F/OSS as an alternative to simple \u201cmake-or-buy.\u201d This alternative will make the most sense for firms with specialized and complex needs.

This number has grown rapidly, and online music sharing has been estimated to result in annual sales losses of $3.1 billion by 2005 for the music industry.\nHere, we strive to understand individual motivations to \u201cfreeload\u201d digital music, such that affected industries could develop effective measures to combat the problem. \n All industries that produce digital goods and face the problem of illegal dwonloading need to be studied.

This has been marketed as a possible gradual transition path between subscription and open access to the scholarly journal literature, and the publishers have pledged to decrease their subscription prices in proportion to the uptake of the hybrid option. The number of hybrid journals has doubled in the past couple of years and is now over 4,300, and the number of such articles was around 12,000 in 2011. On average only 1-2\u00a0% of eligible authors utilize the OA option, due mainly to the generally high price level of typically 3,000 USD. There are, however, a few publishers and individual journals with a much higher uptake. This article takes a closer look at the development of hybrid OA and discusses, from an author-centric viewpoint, the possible reasons for the lack of\nsuccess of this business model. \n In just over two years the number of journals from major publishers offering hybrid Open Access has more than doubled, from approximately 2,000 to over 4,400. Since the overall numbers of journals from these publishers has remained on the same level, the hybrid share has risen from 25\u00a0% to around 50% of all eligible journals. In the same period the number of articles has increased from around 8,000 to 12,000. Roughly half of these articles have been deposited in PubMedCentral by the\npublishers and the share of articles in biomedicine is even higher. \nAmong the lessons learnt is that at the 3,000 USD price level the overwhelming majority of authors do not pay the charges. It is difficult to know to what extent this is due to lack of awareness of the option and of the benefits of OA, unwillingness to pay at the prevailing price level or difficulties in funding the hybrid charge. \nThe overall conclusion of this study must be that the hybrid experiment, at least in the case of the major publishers and with the current price level, has failed as a way of significantly adding to the volumes of OA articles, and that hybrid OA will remain a very marginal phenomenon in the scholarly publishing landscape. \n The hybrid offering seems to have reached a state where the prospects for growth are low in the near future. The big publishers have already included around half their titles, probably most of the ones deemed to have better chances of uptake, and many university presses and society publishers already have a clear majority of their titles in their hybrid offering. Thus there is relative little scope for growth via the addition of new titles. The best chances of rapidly increasing the uptake would be to drastically reduce the price level. But that could in turn put the subscription income at risk. Since the marginal cost of keeping the hybrid offering running is almost zero publishers are likely to continue with this route in its current form in the near future. \nBut in parallel the trend seems now to be for many established publishers to start wholly new full Open Access journals, and in particular journals with very broad disciplinary coverage and reasonable article processing charges.", "implications": "The hybrid offering seems to have reached a state where the prospects for growth are low in the near future.

The availability of songs on file sharing networks has two competing effects on sales that are likely to vary across artists.\nFirst, there is a direct substitution effect on sales as some consumers download rather\nthan purchase music. Second, there is a penetration effect which increases sales, as the spread of an artist\u2019s works helps to make the artist more well-known throughout the population. The first effect is strongest for ex ante well-known artists, while the second is strongest for ex ante unknown artists. Thus file sharing reduces sales for well-known artists relative to unknown artists. Taking account of this heterogeneity in estimating the effect of file sharing provides strong evidence of this distributional effect. Additionally, I find a large aggregate negative effect on sales not apparent in previous work that failed to account for the differential impacts on more and less wellknown artists. The overall negative impact of file sharing arises because aggregate sales are dominated by sales of well-known artists. Using my estimates of the effect of file sharing, counterfactual exercises suggest that the lawsuits brought by the RIAA have resulted in an increase in album sales of approximately 2.9% during the 23 week period after the lawsuit strategy was publicly announced. Furthermore, if files available on-line were reduced across the board by 30%, industry sales would have been approximately 10% higher in 2003. \n The RIAA\u2019s strategy of suing individual file sharing users leads to reduced file sharing activity and sizeable increases in sales.", "implications": "The RIAA\u2019s strategy of suing individual file sharing users leads to reduced file sharing activity and sizeable increases in sales.", "results": "The RIAA\u2019s strategy of suing individual file sharing users leads to reduced file sharing activity and sizeable increases in sales."}}

Innovative firms, it is argued, would have insufficient incentive to innovate should the prospect of monopoly power not be present.

In particular, intellectual property is not necessary for, and may hurt more than help, innovation and growth. We show that, in most circumstances, competitive rents allow creative individuals to appropriate a large enough share of the social surplus generated by their innovations to compensate for their opportunity cost. We also show that, as the number of pre-existing and IP protected ideas needed for an innovation increases, the equilibrium outcome under the IP regime is one of decreasing probability of innovation, while this is not the case without IP. Finally, we provide various examples of how competitive markets for innovative products would work in the absence of IP and critically discuss a number of common fallacies in the previous literature.", "implications": "", "results": ""}}

The dependent variable of the study was legal vs illegal downloading of music. A 20-item questionnaire was completed by 84 respondents. The final four questions in the study were guilt-inducing questions(which the respondent was informed of in compliance with ethical primary research); the remainder of the questions were neutral in nature.\n Findings \u2013 The paper finds that the respondents illegally download despite viewing the act as immoral. Respondents choose to morally disengage from the non-ethical nature of the act in an attempt to avoid feeling guilty about illegal downloading and also to avoid any blame being attributed to them personally. Many respondents feel the act of illegal downloading is simply today\u2019s reality and that there is nothing wrong or immoral about illegal downloading. Those who illegally download were less likely to attack the activity for being wrong. Active music fans were more likely to engage in illegal downloading than passive ones. Being a student versus being gainfully employed did not affect downloading behaviour.\n Research limitations/implications \u2013 A limitation of the study was the difficulty in getting people to disclose the truth about their own ethical violations. A related limitation was the difficulty in obtaining respondents, since participation in such a study meant revealing their music consumption behaviour. However, in the end, social networking proved to be a successful way of recruiting participants.\n Practical implications \u2013 The results cast light on the obstacles managers in the music business face in eliminating music piracy.\n Social implications \u2013 The results show the reasons for the difficulties in eliminating this widespread crime, because of the ethical ambiguity involved.\n Originality/value \u2013 The study has the effect of explaining music piracy very clearly through the application of ethical/psychological theory. This has not been done before. \n This paper investigates this issue through an ethics/psychological lens. It identifies the main offenders of this illegal activity and examines the underlying factors that underpin the commitment of such violations, to help us understand why those responsible act in such a dishonest way.

The \u2018all rights reserved model\u2019 that is tenaciously incentivized by the current legislative framework is, indeed, all but dominant: it is overcome by \u2018open\u2019 and \u2018interactive\u2019 models that take full advantage from the architecture of the online environment and from flexible forms of copyright licensing.

In order to show how the market diverges from the on line distribution model of digital content envisaged at legislative level, in the first section we give an account of the digital age turmoil and expectations, so to show how evidence about on line distribution of digital content is needed. This need is further confirmed by the literature review about distribution models for digital content that we after carried out in section 2. In sections 3 and 4 we describe the methodology followed and present the initial results obtained, which will be further analyzed in section 5 via a cluster analysis. In section 6 we comment and discuss those last so to illustrate, in section 7, our conclusions. We affirm that while the current legal framework, though biased towards a pre-determined solution for online distribution of digital content, has not inhibited the development of a kaleidoscopic market for online distribution, an enabling legal framework could foster it further and, by doing this, could favour the match between the demand and the supply of digital content. \n This study shows how legal, technological and economic features operate as \u2018differentiating factors\u2019 among the models of digital distribution. In other words, it answers the question on what are the key determinants of the models of online distribution and to what extend the choice of the copyright regime influences the model of distribution:\n The study concludes that the current legal framework does not answer to the needs and wants of consumers of digital content and that, on the contrary, they should be encompassed within a new and revised copyright law.", "implications": "The study concludes that the current legal framework does not answer to the needs and wants of consumers of digital content and that, on the contrary, they should be encompassed within a new and revised copyright law.", "results": "This study shows how legal, technological and economic features operate as \u2018differentiating factors\u2019 among the models of digital distribution.

Using regressions analysis, we find no impact of piracy on theater attendance, and a strong impact on video rentals and purchases.

Traditionally, two arguments are opposed concerning the impact of music file sharing on CD sales. On the one hand, MP3 downloads only reduces sales of legitimate CDs (the \"competition effect\"). On the other hand, consumption of free MP3s could lead people to buy CD which they would never have bought otherwise (the \u201csampling effect\u201d). Because the court in the Napster case and some academic researchers have dismissed this sampling effect, this article seeks to assess whether sampling does indeed occur and in the affirmative what are the relative contributions of the positive sampling and the negative competition effects of MP3 files on CD purchases. To do so, we administered an anonymous online survey in two French graduate schools from May 26 to June 3, 2004. We find that there are two populations: explorers and pirates. For the explorers, MP3 downloading from P2P networks has a positive impact on CD consumption. For the pirates, anonymous file-sharing on the internet and intranets has a negative effect on CD consumption, while physical exchanges have a positive effect. \n The estimation results have two implications. First, new business models should try and better discriminate between these two types of users of digital music in order to extract more surplus from the true music fans. Secondly, new business models should also encourage the formation of online communities as our results suggest that people who share music through personal contacts among a community have a higher probability to purchase more CDs.", "implications": "The estimation results have two implications.

Copyright and patent laws do this by providing qualifying authors and inventors with a bundle of exclusive rights relating to the use and development of their creations. Importantly, however, these fields differ greatly in the ways that they determine whether some new creation is sufficiently innovative to merit legal protection. Copyright law sets the creativity bar especially low for new works of authorship, whereas patent law demands that a putative inventor prove that her creation is highly innovative. Relatively little research has focused on whether the different IP thresholds affect the incentives and behavior of creators.\n Legal scholarship on the effects of differing IP thresholds on creators has generally relied on standard economic assumptions about the way that people respond to incentives. Creators are assumed to be rational and to respond to increased incentives by producing more and better creations. According to this reasoning, because patent law requires more creativity as a precondition to the conferral of IP rights compared to what copyright law requires, creators subject to the patent regime will be encouraged to be more creative than those subject to the copyright regime.\n Recent research in the social sciences, however, suggests that the connection between incentives and behavior \u2014 particularly with regard to creativity \u2014 is not always so straightforward. Although some research indicates that providing incentives to act creatively has the expected effect of increasing creativity, other research suggests that offering certain types of incentives can undermine creative behavior. For example, monetary incentives to perform creative tasks may dampen creativity. Moreover, and importantly for our purposes, increasing the magnitude of an incentive to be creative may not always lead to more or better behavior. Once creativity incentives are sufficiently salient or intense, there is a risk that people will be overly focused on achieving the incentive and \u201cchoke.\u201d\n In the series of experiments reported in this Article, we extend the research on the effects of incentives for creativity into the realm of intellectual property. Specifically, we test whether the existence of a creativity threshold that conditions entry into a prize lottery on meeting certain performance standards affects how creative people are. The experiments reported here involve various creativity tasks in which subjects are randomly assigned to conditions that are intended to model the different creativity thresholds employed by copyright and patent law. Doing so allows us to test whether the existence and nature of a threshold increases, decreases, or does not affect subjects\u2019 creativity.\n This research contributes to the growing debates about whether copyright law\u2019s creativity threshold is set too low and should be increased and whether patent law\u2019s creativity threshold is appropriately set. More broadly, this research adds to the growing literature in law, psychology, economics, and management on the effects of incentives on behavior. \n For relatively low-stakes creativity involving nonprofessional creators who are motivated externally, low thresholds may not create significant incentives, which suggest for this case copyright law is an incentive for creation.", "implications": "For relatively low-stakes creativity involving nonprofessional creators who are motivated externally, low thresholds may not create significant incentives, which suggest for this case copyright law is an incentive for creation.", "results": "For relatively low-stakes creativity involving nonprofessional creators who are motivated externally, low thresholds may not create significant incentives, which suggest for this case copyright law is an incentive for creation."}}

On the other side of the Atlantic, however, many European countries give creators, at least in their copyright laws, much stronger rights to attribution. At first blush it may seem that the U.S. has gotten it wrong, and the Europeans have made a better policy choice in providing to creators a right that they value. But for reasons we will explain in this Article, matters are a lot more complicated than that. \n This Article reports a series of experiments that are the first to attempt to quantitatively measure the value of attribution to creators. In previous research, we have shown that creators of IP are subject to a \u201ccreativity effect\u201d that results in them assigning substantially higher value to their works than neoclassical economic theory predicts. The first two experiments reported in this Article suggest a way that the creativity effect may be reduced \u2013 creators are willing to sacrifice significant economic payments in favor of receiving attribution for their work. The value to creators of attribution raises the question whether U.S. IP law should be re-structured to provide attribution as a creator\u2019s default right. \n The third and most important experiment reported here casts doubt on the value of giving creators such a default right, because creators value attribution differently depending on whether the legal rule gives it to them as an initial entitlement or not. When creators are given a right to attribution as a default they value credit four times higher than when attribution is not the default option. Our findings make clear that creators value attribution, and that the prospect of obtaining it can lead to a more efficient level of transacting. At the same time, and paradoxically, our findings also suggest that before we restructure American law, which provides no right to attribution for the vast majority of creators, we need to take care, because it is possible, under conditions that we will describe, that providing creators with a default right to attribution will result in less efficient transacting. \n Finally, our findings have important implications for property theory which are broader than IP law or attribution rights. Our third experiment suggests that a party who enjoys a default legal right as part of her initial complement of rights will tend to treat that legal right in a fashion similar to any other form of initial entitlement, and overvalue it relative to what neoclassical theory would predict. This suggests a principle regarding how to efficiently structure default rules in any setting. All other factors being equal, an efficiently-structured default rule will locate the initial legal entitlement in the party who is either less likely to overvalue the entitlement, or, if overvaluation seems inevitable regardless of where the initial entitlement is placed, is likely to overvalue it less. \n Makes a case for attribution rights not being a part of copyright protection.", "implications": "Makes a case for attribution rights not being a part of copyright protection.", "results": "Makes a case for attribution rights not being a part of copyright protection."}}

National and international legislation, including the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA), and the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), have generated protests online and in the streets by people who are concerned about the expansion of IP rights. Common to each of these proposals was an expansion in the use of criminal sanctions to deter IP violations. Many copyright owners and the associations that represent them support criminal enforcement of IP, including the use of imprisonment, to combat the threat of increased IP piracy on the internet and throughout a globalized economy. Others, including a heterogeneous coalition of scholars, activists, and internet based companies like Google and Wikipedia, fear that using criminal sanctions to protect IP will expand already overgrown rights and chill valuable expressive and inventive behavior. \n Scholars and stakeholders have been wrong to assume that criminal sanctions for IP infringement are justified on economic grounds. It is true that criminal sanctions could play an important role in preventing harmful\nbehavior that cannot be deterred through other means. But imposing criminal sanctions is costly. For patent infringement, the costs of imposing criminal sanctions are very unlikely to exceed its benefits. Civil sanctions will probably be sufficient for creating the optimal amount of infringing behavior. For copyright infringement, civil sanctions alone should be sufficient to deter nearly all types of harmful conduct. There is an economic case for imposing criminal sanctions for copyright infringement only with respect to a discrete set of activities: massive reproduction and sales of commercially valuable works. We have arrived at the conclusion that the case for criminal IP sanctions is weak or nonexistent while putting to one side both noneconomic considerations, such as moral or deontological objections to criminal IP sanctions, and economic concerns about the efficacy of IP in promoting innovation. Once those considerations are added to the calculus, we suspect that the argument for criminal sanctions for IP infringement will disintegrate almost entirely. \n Many IP stakeholders and scholars have operated under the assumption that there is an economic case for criminal IP sanctions. Criminal sanctions for IP infringement are thought to be justified by the possibility of deterring or incapacitating would-be infringers. When criminal IP sanctions have been criticized, the criticism has usually come from a normative position outside of economics-moral rights, for instance.\" The economic case for criminal sanctions is usually treated as unassailable.

It is true that criminal sanctions could play an important role in preventing harmful\nbehavior that cannot be deterred through other means. But imposing criminal sanctions is costly. For patent infringement, the costs of imposing criminal sanctions are very unlikely to exceed its benefits. Civil sanctions will probably be sufficient for creating the optimal amount of infringing behavior. For copyright infringement, civil sanctions alone should be sufficient to deter nearly all types of harmful conduct. There is an economic case for imposing criminal sanctions for copyright infringement only with respect to a discrete set of activities: massive reproduction and sales of commercially valuable works. We have arrived at the conclusion that the case for criminal IP sanctions is weak or nonexistent while putting to one side both noneconomic considerations, such as moral or deontological objections to criminal IP sanctions, and economic concerns about the efficacy of IP in promoting innovation. Once those considerations are added to the calculus, we suspect that the argument for criminal sanctions for IP infringement will disintegrate almost entirely. \n Many IP stakeholders and scholars have operated under the assumption that there is an economic case for criminal IP sanctions. Criminal sanctions for IP infringement are thought to be justified by the possibility of deterring or incapacitating would-be infringers.

Traditional conceptions of the value of IP rely on assumptions about human rationality derived from classical economics. The law assumes that when people make decisions about buying, selling, and licensing IP they do so with fixed, context-independent preferences. Over the past several decades, this rational actor model of classical economics has come under attack by behavioral data showing that people do not always make strictly rational decisions. Perhaps the most important research in this field is that related to the \u201cendowment effect\u201d \u2013 the discovery that, contrary to economic predictions, people value the same object more when they own it than when they do not. \n To date, the endowment effect has been observed for a variety of goods including mugs, lottery tickets, and hunting permits. Our experiment establishes a substantial valuation asymmetry between authors of poems and potential purchasers of them. As we explain in detail in the article, we constructed a market for the poems that was modeled on a market for licensing IP. The observed differences in valuation indicate that IP licensing markets may be substantially less efficient that previously believed. Our results suggest that (1) the preferences of IP creators, owners, and purchasers are unstable and dependent on the initial distribution of property rights in creative works, and (2) large gaps arise between purchasers\u2019 willingness to pay and sellers\u2019 willingness to accept even though the poems are non-rival property and the contemplated alienation of the property is therefore only partial. \n Our findings suggest that private transactions in creative goods may face significant transaction costs arising from cognitive biases that drive the price that creators and owners of IP are likely to demand for transfers considerably higher than what buyers will, on average, be willing to pay. This does not mean, of course, that transactions in IP will not take place \u2013 we see such transactions happening out in the world every day. Our research suggests, however, that IP transactions may occur at a level that is significantly suboptimal, and that the baleful effect of cognitive and affective biases is likely to be more serious for transactions in works of relatively low commercial value, or for which no well-established custom or pattern helps to inform valuation. These results have considerable implications for the structuring of IP rights, IP formalities, IP licensing, and fair use.", "implications": "", "results": ""}}

How can the rights holders\u2019 authorization best be ascertained, through the law or through contract? Can the exceptions and limitations in the copyright acts of the Members of the Berne Union be amended to alleviate problems of legal uncertainty? \n Legal certainty being the backbone for the development of activities, museums need to have a clear understanding of the rules that apply and should apply to fulfill their mandates which, for the purpose of this Study, are non-commercial as per the ICOM definition.\n The feedback sent by the museums reveals the following main concerns:\n1) Time spent and costs incurred for the completion of a digital inventory and the creation of corresponding databases and for management of rights when mounting exhibitions;\n2) The boundaries of the making available of the collection to the public on their websites, for information, enjoyment and research and study. \n Recommendations to the museum community\n 1.

Judicial decisions, private enforcement, and public dialogue ignore innovation and overemphasize the harms of copyright infringement. Just to pick one example, \u201cpiracy,\u201d \u201ctheft,\u201d and \u201crogue websites\u201d were the focus of debate in connection with the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA) and Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA). But such a debate ignores the effect of copyright law and enforcement on innovation. Even though innovation is the most important factor in economic growth, it is difficult to observe, especially in comparison to copyright infringement.\n This article addresses this problem. It presents the results of a groundbreaking study of 31 CEOs, company founders, and vice-presidents from technology companies, the recording industry, and venture capital firms. Based on in-depth interviews, the article offers original insights on the relationship between copyright law and innovation. It also analyzes the behavior of the record labels when confronted with the digital music revolution. And it traces innovators\u2019 and investors\u2019 reactions to the district court\u2019s injunction in the case involving peer-to-peer (p2p) service Napster.\n The Napster ruling presents an ideal setting for a natural experiment. As the first decision to enjoin a p2p service, it presents a crucial data point from which we can trace effects on innovation and investment. This article concludes that the Napster decision reduced innovation and that it led to a venture capital \u201cwasteland.\u201d The article also explains why the record labels reacted so sluggishly to the distribution of digital music. It points to retailers, lawyers, bonuses, and (consistent with the \u201cInnovator\u2019s Dilemma\u201d) an emphasis on the short term and preservation of existing business models.\nThe article also steps back to look at copyright litigation more generally. It demonstrates the debilitating effects of lawsuits and statutory damages. It gives numerous examples, in the innovators\u2019 own words, of the effects of personal liability. It traces the possibilities of what we have lost from the Napster decision and from copyright litigation generally. And it points to losses to innovation, venture capital, markets, licensing, and the \u201cmagic\u201d of music.\nThe story of innovation in digital music is a fascinating one that has been ignored for too long. This article aims to fill this gap, ensuring that innovation plays a role in today\u2019s copyright debates. \n Innovation is crucial to economic growth. But the difficulty of accounting for it leads courts and policymakers to ignore it in today\u2019s debates.

First, we define artistic innovation. Second, we review the literature on its determinants, identifying some gaps. In particular, we observe that existing research mostly focuses on macro-environmental factors and tends to ignore the role of the organizations themselves. Thus, drawing from the organizational literature on innovation we formulate testable propositions that relate organizational factors to artistic innovation. We hope that our focus on organizational factors contributes to a more comprehensive framework on the determinants of artistic innovation in particular and programming in general. \n The authors have provided a working definition of artistic innovation. They have reviewed the literature and observed two main theoretical perspectives (economical and sociological) and three levels of explanation (macro, meso and micro), noting that that both theoretical perspectives\ntend to focus on the effect of macro-environmental (demand and supply) and meso (funding mix) factors rather than on organizational ones (such as size, age, structure and power distribution). They also observed that the empirical evidence for both the macro and meso factors is rather mixed and inconclusive and have provided new theoretical propositions about the role of funding mix that take these limitations into account.\nThey also bridged the gap identified in the literature by drawing on the organizational literature on innovation, in a manner consistent with the specific nature of arts organizations, drawing from the behavioral theory of the firm to suggest that the gap between performance and\naspiration levels, together with the availability of slack resources, might drive artistic\ninnovation. In developing this overarching argument, they offer seven testable propositions that also include the role of art managers\u2019 background in determining the organizational preferences. \n The authors pose the question to what extent society's preoccupation with commercialization is justified.

But all too often they find themselves thwarted.\n A survey of communication scholars\u2019 practices, conducted by the Ad Hoc Committee on Fair Use and\nAcademic Freedom in the International Communication Association (ICA), reveals that copyright\nignorance and misunderstanding hamper distribution of finished work, derail work in progress, and\nmost seriously, lead communication researchers simply to avoid certain kinds of research altogether.\nNearly half the respondents express a lack of confidence about their copyright knowledge in relation\nto their research. Nearly a third avoided research subjects or questions and a full fifth abandoned\nresearch already under way because of copyright concerns. In addition, many ICA members have\nfaced resistance from publishers, editors, and university administrators when seeking to include\ncopyrighted works in their research. Scholars are sometimes forced to seek copyright holders\u2019\npermission to discuss or criticize copyrighted works. Such permission seeking puts copyright holders\nin a position to exercise veto power over the publication of research, especially research that deals with contemporary or popular media.\n These results demonstrate that scholars in communication frequently encounter confusion, fear, and\nfrustration around the unlicensed use of copyrighted material. These problems, driven largely by\nmisinformation and gatekeeper conservatism, inhibit researchers\u2019 ability both to conduct rigorous\nanalyses and to develop creative methodologies for the digital age.\n Communication scholars can benefit by developing best practices standards for the most ample and\nflexible copyright exemption permitting unlicensed use of copyrighted materials: fair use. While nonU.S. members will not be able to apply this doctrine directly to work done outside the United States, having this interpretation established for U.S. scholars will expand opportunities within a large area of communication research, encourage international scholars to explore their own nations\u2019 copyright exemptions, and provide an important benchmark for non-U.S. scholars looking for models as\ncopyright reform proceeds. \n - 387 communications researchers responded to this survey, primarily from the US and Canada.\n - The survey indicated heavy reliance on usage of and access to copyrighted works for analyising and criticising: 18 percent for all or nearly all of research; 36 percent for some; 32 percent for a small portion; and 14 percent for none.\n - Other uses require regular reproduction of works in communication research, such as showing film clips in experiments.  16 percent of respondents reported using an entire copyrighted work for purposes other than analysis or critique, and they identified uses of copyrighted material as particularly important for research.\n - The majority of research rated their knowledge of copyright as 'good' or better but also actively seek guidance: 15 percent always seek guidance on use of copyrighted material; 24 percent usually; and 37 percent at least occasionally.

As a result, enforcement of rights occurs\non a country-by-country-basis. With respect to online on-demand uses of their creative works, authors of music and audiovisual works as well as holders of related rights enjoy an exclusive right of making their works available online to the public \u201cin such a way that members of the public can access them from a place and at a time individually chosen by them\u201d. In practice, online on-demand services also often involve a relevant act of reproduction of copyright protected works which entails the clearance of a second type of right, namely the reproduction right.\n Some stakeholders have suggested that the current copyright regime makes the clearance of rights for cross-border online uses an unnecessarily complex as well as resource-consuming process. Multinational service providers indeed often have to negotiate required rights separately for several territories since licensing content on a territory-by-territory basis (territorial licensing) appears to be a common practice in Europe. This arguably raises barriers to cross-border online access and prevents the online sphere from realising the full economic potential associated with the borderless nature of the internet.\n In this report, we take territorial licensing as consisting of rightholders exercising the territorial nature of copyright by limiting the geographical scope of the rights granted to  licensee to a proper subset of EU Member States within a particular transaction. In line with this definition, the territorial nature of copyright is in itself not a sufficient condition for territorial licensing to take place. Indeed, the decisions of licensors to restrict the geographical scope of licences (i.e. to license on a territory-by-territory basis), are based on private motivations and depend on the wider institutional context, not only on the territorial nature of copyright. This report analyses the private motivations underlying the choice of territorial licensing in the current institutional framework in order, in a nutshell, to answer the following question: would a limitation to the practice of territorial licensing improve social welfare? The report focuses on two kinds of copyright-protected works, recorded music and audiovisual works. \n The authors state  that changes to the licensing model could likely be adopted in response to the reform of the copyright framework and that such changes may also deny the gains that policy-makers hoped to achieve.\nHowever, they state that theory alone is unlikely to give strong predictions and that the relevant mechanisms discussed under the headings of Vertical Agreements and Price Discrimination often have ambiguous effect.

We present\na first series of experiments on individual creativity where subjects face creativity tasks where, in \none case, ex-ante goals and constraints are imposed on their answers, and in the other case no \nrestrictions apply. The effects of financial incentives in stimulating creativity in both types of \ntasks is then tested, together with the impact of personal features like risk and ambiguity \naversion. Our findings show that, in general, financial incentives affect \u201cclosed\u201d (constrained)\ncreativity, but do not facilitate \u201copen\u201d (unconstrained) creativity. However, in the latter case \nincentives do play a role for ambiguity-averse agents, who tend to be significantly less creative \nand seem to need extrinsic motivation to exert effort in a task whose odds of success they don\u2019t \nknow. The second set of experiments aims at exploring group creativity in contexts where the \n\u201ccorporate culture\u201d is either cooperative or individualistic.

Two factors, cost savings from CD purchase and the low moral reasoning ability of Internet users, have been frequently attributed as rationales for this behavior. Music download, however, can also be interpreted as a value maximizing behavior that chooses between the values from consuming illicit and legitimate music, wherein the consumption value is partly dependent on one\u2019s degree of fashion involvement since music is fashionable. This paper presents a conceptual model of music download by looking at and integrating these seldom noticed perspectives with traditional explanations. An analysis of 834 samples drew from a survey of P2P users in Taiwan reveals that: people are maximizing value while downloading music; and that fashion involvement influences the perception of consumption value from music download. This study also found that moral reasoning moderate the relationships among fashion involvement, consumption value, and behavioral intention to download music. \n The authors have extracted three primary findings that may contribute to our knowledge regarding the behavioral intention to download music:\n Simply proclaiming intellectual property rights and the norm of anti-piracy may be ineffective for diminishing unauthorized music download.

An increasing of the speed of internet and the high technologies of digital compression are factors that made a digital piracy happen easily. Moreover, the lower cost of hi-speed internet is the incentive of the software and digital media piracy occurrences. This is only one of many reasons which cause digital piracy. As Thailand was ranked 13th in the most software piracy in the world in 2003, there are a lot of concerns about the high increasing of the digital piracy in Thailand. This study focuses on one of the digital piracy model, and uses The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) as a based theory to determine the factors influencing software and digital piracy. Attitude, Subjective norms and Perceived Behavioral Control are the factors described in TPB as they affect to the intention to create the behavior. Past Behavior is another factor added in this study apart from TPB, which has an impact to the piracy intention. The digital piracy behavior model was developed in this study, and the five hypotheses were proposed. A survey is used to collect data for testing the constructs of the research. Almost four hundred people in Thailand were asked to answer the questionnaire which was developed from an effective guideline to examine the constructs in TPB. Attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control and past behavior were found significantly to be predictors of digital piracy intention. Moreover, the digital piracy intention was a greatest determinant of digital piracy behavior as described in TPB. The implication of this study is to identify the digital piracy factors which relate to people's behavior and to model the digital piracy behavior framework for better understanding of digital piracy behavior. In addition, using the result of this research, a better understanding of the cause of the piracy intention emerges. These can be used to help fighting with a software and digital media piracy in Thailand.", "implications": "", "results": ""}}

Of these mechanisms, however, patents tend to be the least emphasized by firms in the majority of manufacturing industries, and secrecy and lead time tend to be emphasized most heavily. A comparison of our results with the earlier survey findings of Levin et al. (1987) suggests that patents may be relied upon somewhat more heavily by larger firms now than in the early 1980s. For the protection of product innovations, secrecy now appears to be be much more heavily employed across most industries than previously. Our results on the motives for patent indicate that firms patent for reasons that often extend beyond directly profiting from a patented innovation through either its commercialization or licensing. In addition to the prevention of copying, the most prominent motives for patenting include the prevention of rivals from patenting related inventions (i.e., \"patent blocking\"), the use of patents in negotiations and the prevention of suits. We find that firms commonly patent for different reasons in \"discrete\" product industries, such as telecommunications equipment or semiconductors. In the former, firms appear to use their patents commonly to block the development of substitute by rivals, and in the latter, firms are much more likely to use patents to force rivals into negotiations. \n By limiting entry, patent portfolio may help prevent breakdowns in negotiations over intellectual property.", "implications": "By limiting entry, patent portfolio may help prevent breakdowns in negotiations over intellectual property.", "results": "By limiting entry, patent portfolio may help prevent breakdowns in negotiations over intellectual property."}}

The research project focused on copyright law and the digitisation of CHIs\u2019 collections. The digitisation of M\u0101ori cultural heritage adds another dimension to the activities of New Zealand CHIs, and this area was also explored in the interviews. \n The objectives of CHIs are to protect, preserve, and facilitate accessibility to cultural entities in the interests of research and education, and the general public interest in cultural matters. In line with overseas practice, New Zealand\u2019s CHIs make use of digital technologies to achieve their objectives. However, many items in CHIs\u2019 collections are protected by copyright. To make a copy of such items without the consent of the copyright owner is an infringement of copyright. Nevertheless, for various reasons including those that are linked to copyright law itself, as well as practical matters such as inadequate resourcing for CHIs to trace absent copyright owners, and a lack of metadata relating to some items in CHIs\u2019 collections, most digitisation projects in CHIs proceed without the consent of copyright owners. Indeed, there is very little understanding within CHIs of the complexities of copyright law and how it relates to the practices of digitisation of their collections. \n In essence, the permitted exceptions in the Copyright Act 1994 (\u201cthe Copyright Act\u201d) which are intended to support the preservation and archiving of cultural heritage (\u201cthe archiving exceptions\u201d) are, similarly to equivalent provisions in overseas copyright legislation, unsuitable in a digital environment. For example, the archiving exceptions permit a single digital copy of an item to be made, whereas digitisation inevitably results in multiple copies. In addition, it is unclear whether the archiving exceptions apply to CHIs that are museums. \n In part, this gap between practice and law appears to exist because the broader purposes of digitisation of CHI collections were misconceived by the legislators. This research found that CHIs digitise their collections because they wish to provide accessibility to a more widespread audience. Conversely, the archiving exceptions have been drafted with a view that the main purpose of digitisation is similar to that of analogue reproduction; that is, to preserve a copy of an item in a collection that is in danger of deterioration. \n Another reason for the inadequacy of the archiving exceptions is that, as for all permitted exceptions in national copyright laws, these provisions are required to comply with each of the \u201cthree step test\u201d provisions in Article 13 of the Agreement of Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (\u201cthe TRIPS Agreement\u201d). Part 8 of this report suggests that the three step test requirement can be satisfied while nevertheless providing more appropriate exceptions for CHIs. \n While CHIs\u2019 practices in the area of digitisation of M\u0101ori cultural heritage appear, on the whole, to be robust this report proposes that to provide certainty a new provision to regulate this activity should be inserted into the Copyright Act. The report concludes by recommending further amendments to the Copyright Act to address the current gap between practice and the law that has been revealed by the research. \n The objectives of CHIs are to protect, preserve, and facilitate accessibility to cultural entities in the interests of research and education, and the general public interest in cultural matters.\nIn line with overseas practice, New Zealand\u2019s CHIs make use of digital technologies to achieve their objectives.

Thus, of the 188 countries, 32 have no library exception in their domestic copyright statutes. These basic statistics suggest strongly that exceptions for libraries and archives are fundamental to the structure of copyright law throughout the world, and that the exceptions play an important role in facilitating library services and serving the social objectives of copyright law. The most common subject matter of the statutes is making copies (usually single copies) of works for readers, researchers, and other library users, and making copies for preservation of materials in the collections. Almost as frequently, countries have enacted statutes authorizing libraries to make copies for replacement of works that have suffered damage or loss.\n These three topics long have been a mainstay of library exceptions, but recent years have brought revisions that reflect changing needs and new technologies. Most significantly, the European Union adopted a 2001 directive that authorized member countries to make digitized copies of works available to users on the premises of the library for research and study. That provision has been adopted in many of the European countries, and analogous statutes have been made a part of domestic law in countries beyond the E.U. On the other hand, relatively few countries have enacted truly distinctive law that breaks from various trends in lawmaking to address newly emerging problem areas at the border between copyright and digital technologies. Among the countries that have enacted extensive and original statutes in recent years are Canada, the Russian Federation, and the United Kingdom.\n While few countries have enacted comparable major changes, at any given time many countries are either revising their library exceptions or adopting entirely new copyright acts. Indeed, Mauritius and Seychelles adopted wholly new copyright acts in 2014. Revisions of selected copyright statutes have occurred during just the last several months in numerous European countries and in Canada, Mexico, Peru, and Singapore. Research on worldwide copyright developments is a dynamic pursuit. \n None stated.", "implications": "None stated.", "results": "None stated."}}

The psychological determinants of music piracy behaviour were modeled in part with (1991) Ajzen\u2019s theory of planned behaviour.

This study attempts to address this question by analyzing how the HADOPI \u201cthree strikes\u201d law in France affected digital music sales on the iTunes music store. To do this, we obtained a panel of iTunes sales data from the four major music labels (Universal\nMusic, Warner Music, EMI Music and Sony Music) across a broad set of countries. We then applied a difference-in-difference approach, using sales trends in a control group of European countries to simulate the counterfactual of what music sales in France would have been if HADOPI had not been passed. Our results suggest that increased consumer awareness of HADOPI caused iTunes song and album sales to increase by 22.5% and 25% respectively relative to changes in the control group. In terms of robustness, we find that these sales changes are similar for each of the four major music labels, suggesting that our results are not peculiar to any particular label. We also find that the observed sales increase is much larger in genres that, prior to HADOPI, experienced high piracy levels (e.g., Rap and Hip Hop) than for less pirated genres (e.g., Christian music, classical, and jazz). This strengthens the causal interpretation of our results since if HADOPI is causing pirates to become legitimate purchases, its effects should be stronger for heavily pirated music than it is for other music genres. \n The mains results of this study are:\n \"For policy-makers, our results may have important implications in other countries that are considering passing similar graduated response laws, as well as in France where a number of parties oppose the continued existence of the law.

Our findings indicate that, as a lower bound, international box office returns in our sample were at least 7% lower than they would have been in the absence of pre-release piracy.

The Motion Picture Association of America estimates that US studios lose more than $3 billion annually in box office revenue from piracy. They have launched a major effort to prevent these losses. Yet their efforts are hampered by the ex post, counterfactual, and indirect methods by which losses are usually estimated. This paper addresses these issues directly. We develop and estimate a statistical model of the effects of piracy on the box-office performance of a widely-released movie. The model discredits the argument that piracy increases sales, showing unambiguously that Internet piracy diminished the box-office revenues of a widely released motion picture. The model overcomes a major weakness of counterfactual or \u201cbut for piracy\u201d methods widely used to estimate damages. These counterfactual methods violate the \u201cnobody knows\u201d principle because they forecast what the movie would have earned in the absence piracy. The model we present does not violate this basic principle of motion picture uncertainty. We estimate that pre-release and contemporaneous Internet downloads of a major studio movie accelerated its box-office revenue decline and caused the picture to lose about $40 million in revenue. \n This paper develops a model of piracy and revenue dynamics that permits early detection of piracy, directly tests the competing hypotheses regarding the effect of piracy on box office revenue dynamics, and does not violate the \u201cnobody knows\u201d principle.

TDM is, according to some, a growing and very promising economic sector. Its applications seem to be full of potentialities, in a whole range of sectors, from forensic investigation, to predictive marketing and scientific research in all kinds of sectors (be they commercial or not). At the same time, in today\u2019s world, most information becomes available in a digital format, either from its first creation or because of the growing digitization of existing print archives.\nResearch is more and more relying on data analysis techniques and, as the quantity of information grows, so does the need to be able to rely on data analysis, because computers and software will more and more have to be called upon to analyze quantities of materials which human beings will, for time and resources reasons, no more have the possibility to read and screen. Data analysis also offers the possibility to uncover new relationships between information and data which science had always been unaware of.\nFrom a legal point of view, data analysis raises various issues, one of the important one being probably privacy and personal data protection. This Study however concentrates only on intellectual property, and particularly copyright and database protection (sui generis right).\nA few countries in the world have adopted or are in the process of adopting specific copyright provisions to introduce a data analysis exception in their legislation. The purpose of this Study was to describe how data analysis fits within the present legal context in Europe (both in terms of copyright and of database protection), to highlight the issues which may constitute obstacles or difficulties when applying the existing legal texts, and to analyze whether a new exception for data analysis would be useful or necessary. The purpose was not to suggest ready-to-use provisions for a new possible directive but only to give directions and make suggestions. \n On the basis of our analysis, our suggestion is to have a new specific data analysis exception which would be inspired from, and contain partly the same conditions than, the scientific research exceptions, but which would have its own peculiarities. The suggestions are made only for TDM, not for scientific research in general.\nThe main reasons which, in our view, justify that a specific TDM exception be added to the existing legal framework have been explained in the Study and, in summary, are the following:\n- the present situation regarding the research scientific exceptions in the InfoSoc Directive and in Database Directive is not harmonized;\n- the exceptions for scientific research can be waived by contract;\n- there is a controversy as to whether the exceptions apply to \u201cillustrate scientific research\u201d or \u201cfor scientific research as such\u201d;\n- the copyright exceptions in the InfoSoc Directive are limited \u201csolely for scientific research\u201d, which may be seen as excluding projects where, in addition to a scientific research objective, there may be other ancillary objectives;\n- the two directives impose mentioning the authors\u2019 names and/or the sources, which may not always make sense for data analysis.\n The main characteristics and contents of this new exception would be:\n- the exception would only apply where the purpose is mainly (and not \u201csolely\u201d) scientific research;\n- it would not just serve \u201cto illustrate scientific research\u201d but would apply more broadly in cases of \u201cscientific research\u201d;\n- it would only apply where justified by non-commercial purposes;\n- mentioning the sources or the names of the authors of the preexisting materials would not be an obligation but be left to the discretion of the researcher(s);\n- it would be an exception to the reproduction right (InfoSoc Directive and Database Directive), the adaptation right (both under the Database Direction and as part of the reproduction right in the InfoSoc Directive) and the extraction right (Database Directive);\n- it would not apply to tools designed for data analysis (which should remain untouched by the exception);\n- it would not apply if the data analysis output substitutes for the pre-existing works or databases and makes the consultation of these pre-existing elements useless;\nStudy of the legal framework of text and data mining (TDM) 117\n- it would only benefit users having a lawful access to the data;\n- it could not be overridden by contractual terms;\n- it would not be optional for Member States but would be mandatory, so as to ensure a level playing field throughout the European Union. \n The study explains that an exception covering data analysis would be welcome, inspired from, and contain partly the same conditions than, the scientific research exceptions, but which would have its own characteristics.

The Study identified the existence of different acts of reproduction \u2013 upstream and downstream \u2013 in the process of the act of making available, that may complicate the licensing of works for online use and have an impact in terms of conflicts of laws in case of infringement. However, the Study observed that the InfoSoc Directive does not regulate the relation between the making available right and the reproduction right. Both rights are autonomous and can apply cumulatively, so that a single technical act may simultaneously fall under the making available and the right of reproduction, even if those rights are managed separately. In a second part, the Study analyzed two criteria that could help localizing the making available right (country of origin principle and place of the exploitation of the work) and assessed which consequences they would have on the selected topics. It showed that these localization criteria would not solve the bottlenecks found under the current state of law with regard to the reproduction right, as both the uploader and the end user having access to a work made available online would still face issues regarding the copies made in the course of the technological process used.\n The present Study deepens the analysis of the relation between the making available right and the reproduction right. Considering acts of streaming and downloading, it examines whether the copies of works made through the technical process of making them available on the internet fall under the scope of art. 2 of the InfoSoc Directive, and whether these may be exempted under the exception for temporary copy or the exception for private copy provided by art. 5. \n Firstly, we have examined whether the definition of the exclusive rights and the qualification of online exploitations could provide a solution.\n Secondly, there could be an obligation upon the author or initial right holder to transfer only coherent bundles of rights to the effect that the licensee acquires all rights it needs for a particular form of exploitation of a work or other subject matter.

By documenting changes in discourse occurring between 1998 and 2004 over the labeling of music file-sharing as deviant, it seeks to unveil how power machinates in establishing the parameters between acceptable and unacceptable behaviors. In doing so, Foucault's work on power is used as a starting point for investigating strategies employed by corporate elites and file-sharers in order to shift the balance of power. The contest between discourses seeking to restrict or enhance the capacities of free agents in online environments is evidenced in the mutability of a legal discourse seeking to normalize online life. Until now, how the online \u201cmusic pirates\u201d should be disciplined is in a state of flux where certain developments appear to be favoring corporate interests and others, the interests of music file-sharers. In this struggle, online discourses seeking to curtail freedoms and opportunities advanced by corporate elites and online discourses of freedom purported by music file-sharers, are reversible. This reversibility suggests that online, some offline discourses would be a hindrance and as such, their agents could resist the dominant online discourse by engaging in creative behaviors. Likewise, traversing offline producer-led discourses with innovative and creative actions online could lead to consumers' autonomy. This paper concludes that the significance of these online struggles is embedded not only in their outcomes but also in the processes leading to them. Thus, while attempts to curb these online practices and freedoms persist, changes to a discourse guiding trading conditions between the Recording Industry and end-users have been noted, constituting a victory for the latter. \n This article utilizes Michel Foucault\u2019s work in order to account for the changing power relations that exist between corporate elites and online music file-sharers, by analyzing changes in discourses and practices surrounding the free exchange of music through peer-to-peer file-sharing systems. \"In seeking to define and discipline emerging behavior, confrontations between discourses, some in support of the copyright holder, others aiming to defend rights of privacy, free expression and fair use, have created a mutable discursive form.

In a series of high profile decisions, content industries persuaded courts to accept expansive interpretations of contributory enforcement, to create novel doctrines of copyright infringement, and to apply broad interpretations of statutory damage provisions. Many private file-sharers, technology companies, university administrators and Internet service providers have felt the reach of this litigation effort. Yet a significant empirical anomaly exists: even as the copyright industry has ramped up the level of deterrence, online copyright infringements continue unabated.\n Why has the legal battle against file-sharers been so ineffective? The most straightforward explanation is that infringers are not deterred, either because the probability of getting caught remains remote or because the sanctions are not sufficiently salient. If that is the case, the expansive statutory damage award remedies in recent decisions such as Capitol Records v. Thomas-Rasset and Sony BMG v. Tenebaum, carry renewed promise for the entertainment industry. \n In this Article we claim that this deterrence-based approach will prove futile and even counterproductive to the goals of copyright holders. We argue that copyright law faces conditions similar to Prohibition and other historical episodes of enforcement failure. When infringements are widespread, effective deterrence cannot be attained without raising enforcement to levels that undermine the support for the underlying rules. As a result, enforcement has the inadvertent effect of moving behavior in the opposite direction from that intended by the law. In the context of copyright law, enforcement has increased the gap between the social and legal perceptions of copyright law. Because file sharers, as a group, perceive copyright litigation as excessive, this inadvertently strengthens opposition to the legally protected interests of copyright law. \n To further our understanding of the interplay between enforcement and public attitudes, we conduct two empirical studies on norms and copyright law. The results confirm that copyright enforcement is a double-edged sword. While stringent sanctions have a modest deterrent effect on file-sharing behavior, they increase anti-copyright sentiments among frequent offenders. This raises a spectacular challenge for copyright enforcement-the more copyright owners push to step up sanctions for copyright infringements; the more the public resents the protected rights. Consequently, stepping up sanctions tends to increase - rather than decrease - the rate and frequency of infringing activities. Our key results suggest therefore, that more stringent copyright enforcement will further erode respect for copyrights and may prove counterproductive to copyright owners. \n This study found that severe and heightened enforcement of copyright law amongst students who illegally download music from file-sharing sites resulted in anti-copyright resentment, with a positive correlation between degree of backlash and amount of downloading prior to data collection; this suggests a tipping point for amount of downloads to influence a normative shift.  Students receiving severe sanctions reported plans to download more in the future as compared to students receiving moderate sanctions, creating a copyright backlash. \n Sanctions can deter or encourage file-sharing behaviour, and different types of sanctions should be implemented for different types of infringers so as to avoid counterproductive backlash.  In order to influence embedded norms about copyright, music companies must do more to foster desired social behaviours through outreach and marketing campaigns; however, social norms are difficult to manipulate and alternate norm systems are already developing.", "implications": "Sanctions can deter or encourage file-sharing behaviour, and different types of sanctions should be implemented for different types of infringers so as to avoid counterproductive backlash.

While copyright enforcement\nagainst private copying traditionally centered on commercial intermediaries\nand piracy, content owners now also pursue infringement\nactions against consumers and private copiers\ndirectly. While consumers of pirated content have traditionally\nbeen captured indirectly through taxes or blanket licenses, they\nare now subjected to a mass litigation campaign.\nDespite the wide media attention and spectacular headlines,\nlitigation has produced only limited results in the present era of\ndigital downloading and peer-to-peer (or \"P2P\") file swapping.\nLawsuits against private copiers have not halted file-sharing activities.\nAn ever-increasing number of unlicensed downloads are\ntaking place in private homes all over the world. According to\nrecent data, over twelve million people' are simultaneously sharing\n1.08 billion music, movie, and software files on the Internet at\nany given moment.\nWhy are individuals unresponsive to the increased costs ofdownloading unlicensed music? One possible reason is that individuals\nsimply believe that the chances of being caught are too\nremote because there are so many people downloading at any\ngiven moment in time. Downloading fell temporarily during the\ninitial wave of lawsuits but increased again during subsequent\nrounds of lawsuits as file swappers updated their estimation of\nthe chances of getting caught.3\nNotwithstanding the limited deterrent effect of lawsuits on file\nsharing, record industry representatives, who often refer to lawsuits\nin terms of \"educating\" the public on copyright law,4 have\nannounced that they will continue to pursue litigation against individual\nfile swappers. In this Article, we suggest that if litigation\nindeed serves purposes other than deterrence, legal sanctions are\nunlikely to alter the social meaning and legitimacy of peer-topeer\nnetworks and file sharing. Because of a convinced belief\namong copyright users that file sharing should be legal, copyright\nenforcement is challenged by a social norm complication. Drawing\non socio-psychological literature and new data from an empirical\nstudy, we posit that copyright litigation faces an\nimpossibility theorem: lawsuits against file sharers cannot simultaneously\nachieve effective deterrence and promote procopyright\nnorms.\nPart I provides an overview of recent copyright litigation\nagainst copyright infringers on file-sharing networks. In Part 2, we apply the rational choice paradigm to litigation of private\ncopying and complement it with norm-based approaches.\nPart III examines behavioral adjustments and social norms effects\nin a scenario study where students are subjected to varying\nmodalities of copyright law enforcement. The aim of the study is\nto investigate the effect of copyright law enforcement on anticopyright\nnorms among file swappers on peer-to-peer networks\nand to examine differences between experienced users of filesharing\ntechnologies and individuals who have not (yet) engaged\nin file sharing.\nThe evidence from our study raises the hypothesis that deterrence\nand norms work at cross-purposes. Experienced users of\npeer-to-peer technology have internalized an anticopyright norm\nthat cannot be unraveled through enforcement. Anticopyright\nnorms of file swapppers are strengthened when the level of copyright\nenforcement increases, which results in more downloading\nwhenever enforcement is temporarily suspended. Enforcement has an ambivalent effect on individuals who have no experience\nwith file sharing. Severe sanctions do not have a counterproductive\neffect on copyright norms of such \"non-file sharers,\" yet exposure\nto information on copyright enforcement against peer-topeer\nsoftware reinforces the belief or expectation that others are\ndownloading.\nPart IV reflects on the lessons learned from the study, in particular\nwith regard to the policy choices that regulators, courts,\nand copyright-dependent industries face when approaching the\nwidespread use of copyrighted material on file-sharing networks.\nThese options, including criminal prosecutions of digital piracy,\ncopyright education, self-help strategies, and collective licensing,\nare evaluated in light of the interaction of deterrence and anticopyright\nnorms. We will argue that social norm backlash is\nparticularly relevant for copyright law because circumvention\ntechnology and the so-called technological \"arms race\" between\ncontent holders and pirates inevitably create lapses in copyright\nenforcement. During these intervals of reduced enforcement,\nconduct is determined by norms.\nFinally, Part V considers the recent decision by the Supreme\nCourt in MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd., which held that\nproducers of file-sharing applications can potentially be held ac-countable for distributing software. Because Grokster focuses\non the commercial intent of P2P producers, it is doubtful that the\ndecision will be an effective tool in reducing the availability of\nfile-sharing technology. As digital technology becomes more decentralized,\nit is increasingly judgment-proof. File-sharing applications\nare produced in user-driven innovation environments\nthat operate without centralized, residual claimants. Life cycles\nof software applications extend beyond the legal and financial\nstatus of their creators. This suggests that we have only seen the\ntip of the iceberg with regard to lawsuits against private copiers.\nWe use copyright enforcement as a case study for the interaction\nbetween law enforcement and norms in general. The literature\non social norms suggests that when legal sanctions violate\nthe subjective conception of behavior that is being punished, individuals\nrespond differently when that enforcement coincides\nwith preexisting notions of what is just or appropriate. Although\nsome studies have investigated the conflict of deterrence and\nnorms with regard to tax evasion, the dynamics of social norms\nand law enforcement remain poorly understood. This Article addresses\nseveral gaps in the existing literature. While there is an\nabundance of theoretical attention to social norms, there is little\nempirical data on the interaction between norms and law enforcement.\nAlso, this Article supplements the limited literature\non enforcement patterns in copyright law.", "implications": "", "results": ""}}

We report our findings about the time it takes to license a nascent service, if negotiations succeed; the number of record labels and publishers with which new music services typically deal; the general processes through which these licenses evolve; and how changes in the law over the period may have affected the dynamics of these negotiations. We find that copyright law, alongside business practices and professional attitudes, sets complex background rules for these private licensing negotiations.

The Internet provides an opportunity to make archival material more widely accessible; however, repositories\u2019 copyright practices in making their holdings available online may affect the extent to which wider access to archival material is actually achieved. The study employed four different sources of evidence, i.e., the website content of 154 Canadian repositories whose websites feature archival material from the repository\u2019s holdings; copyright\npolicy and procedure documents of those repositories; 106 responses to a questionnaire sent to the staff of those repositories; and 22 interviews with repository staff members. In terms of selection for online access, the study found that the repositories studied prefer to select items that are perceived to incur little risk of copyright infringement (because the copyright has expired or because the repository owns the copyright), or items that require few or no resources to investigate copyright status or obtain copyright authorizations. Thus, with regard to selection, repositories were more restrictive than the law required, largely due to lack of resources.\nAlthough repositories have no legal or professional obligation to enforce others\u2019 copyright interests, they nonetheless attempt to control further uses of their online holdings through the use of technical measures (e.g., low resolution images, watermarks, etc.) or non-technical measures (e.g., conditions placed on further uses), for reasons not necessarily related to copyright. Overall, the study found that repositories\u2019 practices in making their holding available online were more restrictive than copyright law envisages. While this may be due to factors other than copyright, access to online documentary heritage may be limited as a result. \n Making archival holdings available for research and encouraging their use are fundamental goals of professional archival practice. Canadian repositories have seized the Internet as a new opportunity for wider access to their holdings. From the perspective of copyright, they make selected holdings available on the Internet in an uncertain environment without expert advice, and without conducting exhaustive research to be sure of every expiry date or rights holder. However, 80% of the questionnaire respondents think copyright is a problem for archival repositories making their holdings available online. Consequently, they are more restrictive than copyright law requires, both in terms of what they select for online access and in terms of their attempts to control further uses of their holdings for reasons that are associated (rightly or wrongly) with copyright. \n Copyright is widely perceived to be a problem when it comes to making cultural heritage available on the Internet, in that obtaining the necessary copyright clearances is often difficult and, according to digitization manuals, an item cannot be made available on the Internet without the appropriated permissions. The study examined a number of aspects of the copyright practices of Canadian archival repositories relating to making their holdings available on the Internet.

In terms of further uses of online archival holdings, archival repositories, consistent with their onsite practices, want to control further uses of their online holdings in a \u201cquasicopyright-like\u201d way.

When it comes to political or military struggles, in contrast, it might be expected that initially stronger or richer contenders would grow ever stronger and richer still. What has been termed the Paradox of Power (Hirshleifer, 1991) is the observation that very often the reverse occurs: poorer or weaker contestants improve their position relative to richer or stronger opponents. In warfare, small nations have often defeated larger ones, as notably occurred in Vietnam. Individuals, groups, or nations - if rational and self-interested - will equalize the marginal returns of two main ways of generating income: production and mutually advantageous exchange, versus appropriate efforts designed to redistribute income or capture resources previously controlled by other parties. \n We tested two main kinds of predictions: ( 1 ) The first group dealt 'with issues common to much of the game-theoretic and experimental literature. Of these, the major question was the degree to which the experimental outcomes approximated the noncooperative Nash solution, as opposed to a more cooperative outcome generating a larger in- come for the group as a whole. We also compared protocols with randomly varying partners each round as opposed to fixed partners over the entire sequence of play. (2) The second group of predictions dealt with inferences from the specific model of conflict in Hirshleifer ( 1991 ), and specifically those associated with the Paradox of Power. The paradox is that, in many situations, an initially poorer side will end up gaining in relative position in comparison with an initially richer and thus stronger opponent. With regard to the first group of predictions, the experimental observations overwhelmingly supported the Nash as opposed to the Cooperative solution. However, while the Nash solution is much better supported in a dichotomous comparison between the two, the experimental results typically displayed some degree of slippage in the direction of cooperation. The convergence toward Nash was weaker under the fixed partners as opposed to the varying partners protocol, and also was weaker in the mature (sixteenth round) choices than the overall behavior. Together with an observed tendency toward positive correlation of the deviations from the Nash equilibrium, these results are consistent with a \"leaming to cooperate\" interpretation.

This will lead to the formulation of some recommendations that, by viewing the public domain as material that should receive some positive status and protection, might help to support a robust public domain, as advocated by the Development Agenda.\n Our purpose is not to define what should be or not be in the public domain, nor to look\nat the causes of the shrinking of the public domain, or only incidentally. This study is\nsituated beyond the debate as to what should be copyrighted or not, to what extent and for how long. It will not deal with the question of determination of those limitations to intellectual property (as to the scope of the rights, the object of the protection, the adequate duration of the right, etc.). Such delineation is fundamentally a matter for policy that has to be decided by States, both at an international and national level.\nAs a consequence, the public domain that will be sketched here is not only what is left\nafter the contours of copyright have been drawn, but is a repository of resources of its own.\n Accordingly, the recommendations formulated at the end of this study will not focus on the\nscope of copyright and the way to curb it, but will rather try to develop strategies to make the public domain itself flourish and be made more available to the public. This study will also be limited to the public domain as resulting from copyright legal regimes and not by patent or trademark.\n Part I of this study will give an evaluation of the role of the public domain in copyright,\nstarting by a definition of what public domain is and what it should be distinguished from.\nThe public domain in the history and justification of copyright will also be provided.\nPart II will identify the components of the public domain, notably based on an\nillustrative comparison of national legislation. It will also analyse other legislatively granted rights and/or interests that may modify and interfere with the level of accessibility and usability of the copyright-related public domain. Part III will provide a survey of non-legislative and private ordering initiatives, which provide for greater access, use, identification and location of the public domain and other creative material whose conditions of use are akin thereto. Part IV will sketch a possible future for the public domain, by developing the impetus it is gaining in legislative and judicial contexts, the key principles that could govern it for a more positive status, and finally by formulating recommendations in regard to future activities on the public domain in relation to copyright that may be carried out by the World Intellectual Property Organization. \n As far as identification of the public domain is concerned:\n o The territoriality applying to the determination of the public domain should be further\nassessed. Recommendations are difficult to propose in that regard as substituting the\nlaw of the country of origin to the lex loci protectionis would only shift the uncertainty.\nInstead of having to deal with different laws when envisaging an exploitation of creative\nmaterial in different jurisdictions, the user will have to determine the status of the\nresources used according to the law of countries of origin, even for an exploitation\noccurring in a single country.\n o The difficulty of the rule of the comparison of terms applicable to the duration for\nprotection, as provided by Article 7(8) of the Berne Convention, should at least be\nassessed.\no The voluntary relinquishment of copyright in works and dedication to the public domain\nshould be recognised as a legitimate exercise of authorship and copyright exclusivity, to the extent permitted by national laws (possibly excluding any abandonment of moral rights) and upon the condition of a formally expressed, informed and free consent of the author. Further research could certainly be carried out on that point.\n o An exception or attenuation of the lex loci protectionis could be envisaged so as to\nmutually recognize the validity of a dedication to the public domain when valid in the\ncountry of origin of the work.\n o The issue of orphan works should be dealt with at the international level or at least, a\nmutual recognition of the status of the orphan work applied in one country should be\nrecognized by other Parties to the Berne Convention (except when identification or location of the author can be solved in this other country). WIPO should also help to set up networks of information about works in order to facilitate the identification of authors of orphan works. This would clarify the protected or unprotected status of orphan works.\n o International endeavours should be devoted to developing technical or informational\ntools to identify the contents of the public domain, particularly as far as the duration of\ncopyright is concerned. Such tools can be data collections on works, databases of public domain works, or public domain calculators. International cross-operation and cross-referencing of such tools is of particular importance.\n o The 1996 WIPO Treaties could be modified to integrate, in the definition of \u201cRights\nManagement Information\u201d, any electronic information pertaining to public domain works.\n - As far as the availability and sustainability of the public domain is concerned:\no The availability of the public domain should be enhanced, notably through cooperation\nwith cultural heritage institutions and UNESCO (through its work on the preservation of\nintangible cultural heritage).\n o Legal deposit should be encouraged at national level, which might involve some\nfinancial and logistical help for developing countries. At international level, catalogues\nand cross-referencing of deposited works should be set up.\n o The role of cultural heritage institutions, and mainly libraries, in the labelling,\ncataloguing, preserving and making available of public domain works, should be\nrecognised and supported, particularly in the digital environment.\n o Research should be carried out to identify means to promote the divulgation and\nexploitation of public domain material in terms of funding and incentives. The research\ncould include the tool of the domaine public payant, as means to make commercial\nusers of public domain works contribute, through a minimal sum, to the collecting and\nmaintaining of public domain material carried out by public institutions. Where the moral\nright is perpetual, there should be ways of controlling possible abuses in exercising the\ndivulgation or integrity right.\n o Any extension of the scope or duration of copyright and related rights, both at\ninternational and national level, should take into account the empirical effects on the\nsustainability of the public domain.\n - As far as the non-exclusivity and non-rivalry of the public domain is concerned:\no Legal means should be found to prevent the recapture of exclusivity in works that have\nfallen into the public domain, whether through another intellectual property right\n(trademark or right in databases), property rights, other legal entitlements or technical\nprotection, if such exclusivity is similar in scope or effect to that of copyright or is\ndetrimental to non-rivalrous or concurrent uses of the public domain work.\n o The 1996 WIPO Treaties should be amended to prohibit a technical impediment to\nreproduce, publicly communicate or making available a work that has fallen into the\npublic domain.

Recommendations are difficult to propose in that regard as substituting the\nlaw of the country of origin to the lex loci protectionis would only shift the uncertainty.\nInstead of having to deal with different laws when envisaging an exploitation of creative\nmaterial in different jurisdictions, the user will have to determine the status of the\nresources used according to the law of countries of origin, even for an exploitation\noccurring in a single country.\n o The difficulty of the rule of the comparison of terms applicable to the duration for\nprotection, as provided by Article 7(8) of the Berne Convention, should at least be\nassessed.\no The voluntary relinquishment of copyright in works and dedication to the public domain\nshould be recognised as a legitimate exercise of authorship and copyright exclusivity, to the extent permitted by national laws (possibly excluding any abandonment of moral rights) and upon the condition of a formally expressed, informed and free consent of the author. Further research could certainly be carried out on that point.\n o An exception or attenuation of the lex loci protectionis could be envisaged so as to\nmutually recognize the validity of a dedication to the public domain when valid in the\ncountry of origin of the work.\n o The issue of orphan works should be dealt with at the international level or at least, a\nmutual recognition of the status of the orphan work applied in one country should be\nrecognized by other Parties to the Berne Convention (except when identification or location of the author can be solved in this other country). WIPO should also help to set up networks of information about works in order to facilitate the identification of authors of orphan works. This would clarify the protected or unprotected status of orphan works.\n o International endeavours should be devoted to developing technical or informational\ntools to identify the contents of the public domain, particularly as far as the duration of\ncopyright is concerned. Such tools can be data collections on works, databases of public domain works, or public domain calculators. International cross-operation and cross-referencing of such tools is of particular importance.\n o The 1996 WIPO Treaties could be modified to integrate, in the definition of \u201cRights\nManagement Information\u201d, any electronic information pertaining to public domain works.\n - As far as the availability and sustainability of the public domain is concerned:\no The availability of the public domain should be enhanced, notably through cooperation\nwith cultural heritage institutions and UNESCO (through its work on the preservation of\nintangible cultural heritage).\n o Legal deposit should be encouraged at national level, which might involve some\nfinancial and logistical help for developing countries. At international level, catalogues\nand cross-referencing of deposited works should be set up.\n o The role of cultural heritage institutions, and mainly libraries, in the labelling,\ncataloguing, preserving and making available of public domain works, should be\nrecognised and supported, particularly in the digital environment.\n o Research should be carried out to identify means to promote the divulgation and\nexploitation of public domain material in terms of funding and incentives. The research\ncould include the tool of the domaine public payant, as means to make commercial\nusers of public domain works contribute, through a minimal sum, to the collecting and\nmaintaining of public domain material carried out by public institutions. Where the moral\nright is perpetual, there should be ways of controlling possible abuses in exercising the\ndivulgation or integrity right.\n o Any extension of the scope or duration of copyright and related rights, both at\ninternational and national level, should take into account the empirical effects on the\nsustainability of the public domain.\n - As far as the non-exclusivity and non-rivalry of the public domain is concerned:\no Legal means should be found to prevent the recapture of exclusivity in works that have\nfallen into the public domain, whether through another intellectual property right\n(trademark or right in databases), property rights, other legal entitlements or technical\nprotection, if such exclusivity is similar in scope or effect to that of copyright or is\ndetrimental to non-rivalrous or concurrent uses of the public domain work.\n o The 1996 WIPO Treaties should be amended to prohibit a technical impediment to\nreproduce, publicly communicate or making available a work that has fallen into the\npublic domain. There is no legal basis for the enforcement of technical protection\nmeasures applied to the public domain, as public domain status should guarantee the\nright to make re-use, modification, reproduction and communication.

It has never been so important to foster the \u201cvirtuous circle\u201d leading from Research and Development (R&D) investment to jobs \u2013 via innovation, competitive advantage and economic success \u2013 as in today\u2019s world of increasingly globalised markets and the knowledge\neconomy. This process depends on several different factors, but an efficient system of intellectual property rights (IPR) undoubtedly ranks among the most important, given IP\u2019s capacity to encourage creativity and innovation, in all its various forms, throughout the economy.\nEurope already has a long tradition in this area: European countries have played a major part in\nshaping a modern and balanced system of IP rights which not only guarantees innovators their due\nreward but also stimulates a competitive market. It is nevertheless vital to ensure that the system remains a useful instrument in implementing new innovation policies designed to achieve those goals. At the same time, there have been several calls from industry for indicators to measure the economic impact of IP rights. Moreover, in view of the question marks which, in public debate, have sometimes been raised over IP\u2019s role in supporting innovation and creativity, it is essential that facts and figures be produced to ensure such debate is based on sound evidence.\nThat is why the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market (OHIM), acting through the European Observatory on Infringements of Intellectual Property Rights, and the European Patent Office (EPO) decided to join forces and carry out this study in co-operation with the European Commission, in particular DG Internal Market and Services and Eurostat.\nThere have already been several studies on specific IP rights, industrial sectors or countries, but the OHIM-EPO study is the first to quantify the overall contribution made by IPR\u2011intensive industries to the EU economy, in terms of output, employment, wages and trade, taking into account the major\nIP rights (patents, trade marks, designs, copyrights, geographical indications). Despite the\nconservative approach, reflected in the rigorous methodology applied, the main results are very\nimpressive: IPR-intensive industries generate more than a quarter of employment and more than a\nthird of economic activity in the EU. \n IPR-intensive industries are defined as those having an above-average use of IPR per employee. The present study shows that about half of European industries can be considered IPR\u2011intensive. It should be emphasised, however, that all industries use IP rights to some extent. By focusing only on the IPR-intensive industries, this study arguably understates the real contribution of IP rights to the European economy.\nSuch IPR-intensive industries are shown to have generated almost 26% of all jobs in the EU during the period 2008-2010, with almost 21% in trade mark-intensive industries, 12% in design-intensive industries, 10% in patent-intensive industries, and smaller proportions in copyright-intensive and GI-intensive industries.\nOn average over this period, 56.5 million Europeans were employed by IPR-intensive industries, out of a total employment of approximately 218 million. In addition, another 20 million jobs were generated in industries that supply goods and services to the IPR-intensive\nindustries. Taking indirect jobs into account, the total number of IPR\u2011dependent jobs rises to just under 77 million (35.1%). Over the same period, IPR-intensive industries generated almost 39% of total economic activity (GDP) in the EU, worth \u20ac 4.7 trillion. They also accounted for most of the EU\u2019s trade with the rest of the world, with design-intensive, copyright-intensive and GI-intensive industries generating a trade surplus.\nIPR-intensive industries also pay significantly higher wages than other industries, with a wage\npremium of more than 40%.

A key recommendation made by Hargreaves is that the Government create a new fair dealing copyright exception for parody. However, a shortage of empirical data renders policy intervention in this area difficult. The issue is complicated by the inherently creative nature of parody, ambiguity about its definition and the multiplicity of \neconomic and legal approaches that may be applied. \n In December 2011, following a call to tender procedure, the UK Intellectual Property Office (IPO) commissioned the Centre for Intellectual Property Policy and Management (CIPPM) at Bournemouth University to undertake research into the potential effects for rightsholders, creators and audiences of introducing a copyright exception for Parody in the UK. This synopsis reports the key findings from two complementary studies carried out by the researchers. Study I presents new empirical data about the rate and nature of parody content production on the online video platform YouTube, and its impact on commercial exploitation of original works where they can be considered to be part of the same market.  Study II distils regulatory options for a parody exception from a comparative review of seven jurisdictions. \n The current synopsis document contains three parts. First, it discusses the empirical findings from Study I. A sample of 8,299 user-generated music video parodies was constructed relating to the top-100 charting music singles in the UK for the year 2011. Secondly, this synopsis presents a distilled discussion of the legal treatment of parodies in seven  jurisdictions  that  have  implemented  or  are  considering  implementing  a  copyright exception for parody (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Netherlands, UK, and USA). The underlying  principles  (including  economic  and  constitutional)  governing  divergent  legal approaches are identified, and a list of policy options is presented. Thirdly, this synopsis document provides a synthesis of the legal analysis and the empirical data.

It was considered that \"The application or non-application of such a right has a significant impact on the competitive environment within the internal market, since the existence or absence of an obligation to pay on the basis of the resale right is an element which must be taken into account by each individual wishing to sell a work of art. This right is therefore a factor which contributes to the creation of distortions of competition as well as displacement of sales within the Community.\"\n Consistent with these aims, the Directive promoted harmonisation of the substantive conditions for the application of the resale right: (i) eligibility and the duration of protection; (ii) the categories of works of art to which the resale right applies; (iii) the scope of the acts to\nbe covered i.e. all acts involving dealers in works of art; (iv) the royalty rates applicable across defined price bands; (v) the maximum threshold for a minimum resale price attracting\nthe right (\u20ac3,000); and (vi) provisions on third country nationals entitled to receive royalties. The Directive came into force on 1 January 2006.\n At the time the Directive was agreed 4 of the then 15 Member States did not apply the resale right in national law: Austria, Ireland, the Netherlands and the UK. These Member States enjoyed a transitional period to 1 January 2010 during which they could choose not to apply the resale right to the works of eligible deceased artists. These Member States, together with Malta, made use of this provision, and of the option to extend the derogation period for a further 2 years. This derogation comes to an end on 1 January 2012, at which point the Directive must be fully implemented in all Member States.\n Article 11 of the Directive foresees that the Commission should submit to the European Parliament, the Council and the Economic and Social Committee a report on the implementation and the effect of the Directive. This report answers to that requirement. In line with the provisions of Article 11 this Report examines in particular the impact of the Directive on the internal market and the effect of the introduction of the resale right in those Member States that did not apply the right in national law prior to the entry into force of this Directive. It pays particular attention to the position of the Community in relation to relevant markets that do not apply the resale right, assesses the role of the Directive in the fostering of artistic creativity and reviews the situation with regard to the management procedures in the Member States. \n No clear patterns can be established to link the loss of the EU's share in the global market for\nmodern and contemporary art with the harmonisation of provisions relating to the application of the resale right in the EU on 1 January 2006. Neither can any clear patterns currently be established that would indicate systematic trade diversion within the EU away from those Member States which introduced the right for living artists in 2006. Nevertheless, there are clearly pressures on European art markets, in all price ranges, and for both the auction and dealer sectors, and it is recalled that the scope of the application of the resale right will be significantly expanded following the ending of the derogation for the works of deceased artists on 1 January 2012.\nAt the same time, the quality of the administration of the resale right appears to vary considerably across the EU, bringing costs to art market professionals and artists alike. The burden can be particularly high for those at the lower end of the market who are proportionately more deeply affected by the costs of administering the right. The Commission recognises, furthermore, that in some Member States inefficient administration of the resale right presents a not insignificant burden on art market professionals and may also lead to unnecessarily high deductions from the royalties due to artists and their successors. \n \u2022In light of the economic significance of the sector, the Commission considers that market developments should be kept under review. The Commission will undertake a further reporting exercise and deliver its results in 2014.  The Commission will also pursue its commitment to persuading third countries to implement the resale right.\n\u2022 In light of the volume of transactions subject to the resale right, the European Commission also considers that there would be benefit in the exchange of best practice at European level with a view to managing and minimising the administrative costs in all Member states. To this end it intends to establish a Stakeholder Dialogue, tasked with making recommendations for the improvement of the system of resale right collection and distribution in the EU.\n\u2022 More broadly, the European Commission is concerned that collecting societies should operate to a high standard of governance and transparency with regard to their members and to commercial users, and will bring forward a proposal in this regard during 2012 to apply in equal measure to collecting societies administering the resale right.", "implications": "\u2022In light of the economic significance of the sector, the Commission considers that market developments should be kept under review.

The key element was the recently adopted Directive 2013/37/EU amending Directive 2003/98/EC on the re-use of public sector information.\n The amended Directive calls on the Commission to help the Member States implement the new rules by issuing guidelines on recommended standard licences, datasets and charging for the re-use of documents. The guide lines are an important element of the Commission\u2019s efforts to help the EU\u2019s economy to generate more value from data (including scientific data and \u2018big data\u2019 from other sources than the public sector). They will also facilitate the roll-out of open data infrastructures under the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF).\n In August 2013, the Commission launched an online consultation followed by a public hearing and a meeting of a Member States expert group on PSI. The aim was to gather the views of all interested parties on the scope and content of the future Commission guidelines.  The purpose of this Commission Notice is to provide non-binding guidance on the best practices within the three subject areas of particular relevance for the re-use of public sector information in Europe. \n The feedback received shows an increasing trend towards a more open and interoperable licensing system in Europe and agreement on the need for the speedy release of several high-value datasets. With regard to charging, it is clear that a wide range of approaches are in operation, but the newly introduced pricing principles were not called into question by the majority of respondents. The PSI re-use market in Europe is still under development and that guidance on the key elements of the recently revised Directive is urgently needed if full advantage is to be taken of the commercial and non-commercial opportunities offered by the re-use of public data. \n Key recommendations on standard licences, licensing provisions, data release, and charging are laid out in this report for policy guidance.", "implications": "Key recommendations on standard licences, licensing provisions, data release, and charging are laid out in this report for policy guidance.", "results": "The feedback received shows an increasing trend towards a more open and interoperable licensing system in Europe and agreement on the need for the speedy release of several high-value datasets.

At the same time, recipes are not a form of innovation that is effectively covered by law-based intellectual property systems. Via grounded research, we identify three strong implicit social norms related to the protection of recipe IP. Via quantitative research, we find that accomplished chefs enforce these norms, and apply them in ways that enhance their private economic returns from their recipe-related IP.\n In our discussion, we compare the attributes of norms-based and law-based IP systems, arguing that each has different advantages and drawbacks. We also point out that the existence of norms-based IP systems means that many \u201cinformation commons\u201d may prove to be criss-crossed by norms-based fences, with community access controlled by community IP owners. \n Main results of study:\n Policy implications:", "implications": "Policy implications:", "results": "Main results of study:\n Policy implications:"}}

This paper presents a simple model outlining the consumers tradeoff between downloading the movie legally or acquiring it illegally through copying from such networks. The model shows that there are mainly two factors affecting consumer demand for copies: the probability of getting high quality copies and the risk associated with copying. The paper goes on to empirically estimate the probability of getting such high quality copies. To date, our results show that there is a very low probability of obtaining high quality movies. We further tested our model by conducting simulation analyses to better understand current and future consumer behavior. The first simulation shows that, with the current low probability of getting high quality copies, the majority of consumers would prefer to download movies legally. The results of the second simulation focusing on the future behavior of consumers showing that the most important factors are: the risk of being caught, the perceived value of the original, the availability (probability) of high quality copies and the price of the original. Our research findings not only offer insight into the consumer behavior, but also to what extent the movie industry faces piracy. These results may serve as a new impulse for copyright holders and policy makers, allowing them to make appropriate decisions and take targeted actions to fight piracy. \n This paper presents a simple model of consumers tradeoff between buying and copying.

With  respect  to  the  demographic  factors,  male students are more prone to piracy, whereas older students are less likely to engage in such activity. Finally, the key risk variables perceived probability of getting caught when conducting such illegal activity and the resulting penalty to be paid are negatively associated with music piracy behavior.This paper provides important insights which can be used to have tailored policies to alleviate piracy behavior in each country. \n - Different strategies of combating piracy for different countries.

Social Distribution of Content\u201d is an attempt at \nanalyzing the phenomenon of informal cultural content sharing in Poland. It describes \nhow books, music, and movies circulate among Poles who sometimes buy them, but more often than not acquire them via the Internet and borrow or copy them from friends. We focused our study on the comparison of formal and informal circulations of cultural content, in the form of either digital or cultural copies. We decided not to \nstudy broadcast media use, due to the lack of circulating copies that allow comparisons with informal circulations online. \nYet the public discussion, revolving around file sharing networks and more broadly \naround obtaining and making use of cultural content in a digital form, usually situates these practices on the margin of typical activities of Poles. Such practices still seem to be \u2013as they are described in the public discussion- an embarrassing subject; stigmatized as an illegal activity that hurts legal content markets, creators, and intermediaries. \nWe conducted this research study in order to provide this public debate with an \nempirically absed descriptuon of the circulations of content in digital form and \nforemost on the Internet. And also to show the cultural and social aspects of this \nphenomenon that go beyond the question of its legality. First and foremost, we seek \nto explain why informal circulations of culture in digital form are an important issue for research on contemporary culture. Secondly, we stress that exploration into this issue provides important evidence for cultural policy.\nThe goal of our project was purely exploratory \u2013 instead of making rigid assumptionsin order to verify them, we decided to analyze the answers that the respondents put down in the questionnaires, their attitudes, and the opinions they expressed. This approach sought to help us understand how often, in what way, and why \nPoles engage with informal content circulations. \nMost importantly, we chose not to distinguish nor discriminate between legal and\nillegal circulations \u2013 mainly because the border between the two is often fuzzy and \nunclear for people who participate in either of them. Therefore, this is not a report \nabout \u201cpirates\u201d that conduct illegal activities, but rather about people who engage in informal content sharing practices. \nBut abandoning the simple legal-illegal binary has yet another reason. The goal of this report is to foster real dialogue on the issue of acquiring cultural content in Poland. The overuse of labels such as \u201cpiracy\u201d or \u201ctheft\u201d will not improve the chances of establishing such dialogue. An opposition between \u201cformal\u201d and \u201cinformal\u201d is in our opinion a much better way for framing this debate.\nWe conducted a quantitative, survey study and one of our primary goal was to \nestablish the scale and general character of the informal content circulation \u2013\nespecially the distribution of digital formats. The project consisted of two surveys. The first one, a pilot survey, was conducted through computer-assisted personal \ninterviews between May 19 and May 26 of 2011 on a sample of 1004 people over 15 \nyears of age, which was representative for the Polish population. \nThe goal of this survey was to describe the scale and basic characteristics of informal circulation in the whole Polish society. We were in particular interested in differences between Internet users and non-users, and between age groups. \nThe second survey was conducted over the Internet through computer-assisted web interviewson a sample of 1283 people. The survey was conducted on a random \nnationwide sample and the demographic structure of the analyzed set was representative of the Polish Internet user population (according to Nettrack) with \nrespect to gender, age (16 to 50 years old), place of residence, and education. \nWe have focused upon the population of Internet users based on the results of the first survey, according to which non-users do not participate in circulations of digital content. \n Principal conclusions of the report:\n Policy implications:", "implications": "Policy implications:", "results": "Principal conclusions of the report:\n Policy implications:"}}

Therefore, the goal of this study was to determine the factors of perceived consequences and to assess their contribution, as well as the contribution of SUN, to INT.\nThis predictive study developed a quantitative instrument to measure the contribution of the factors of perceived consequences and SUN on INT. In phase one of this study, an anonymous exploratory questionnaire was used to gather a list of perceived consequences. That list was combined with a list of perceived consequences found through an extensive review of the literature and a survey instrument was developed and used in phase two. After data cleaning, a total of 407 responses remained. Exploratory factor analysis incorporating principal component analysis (PCA) identified eight factors of INT: Personal Emotional Consequences (PEC), Freedom Consequences (FRC), Minor Consequences (MIC), Personal Freedom Consequences (PFC), Personal Moral Consequences (PMC), Network Access Consequences (NAC), Self Worth Consequences (SWC), and Industry Financial Consequences (IFC). A model was developed using Ordinal Logistic Regression to determine the contribution of the eight factors of perceived consequences and SUN on INT.\nPEC, PMC, and IFC as well as SUN were found to be significant contributors to INT.

In this paper, we suggest that this diversity of legal rules is largely traceable to differences in the audience in IP cases. Patent, trademark, copyright, and design patent each focus on a different person as the fulcrum for evaluating IP infringement. The fact that patent law focuses on an expert audience while trademark looks to a consumer audience explains many of the differences in how patent and trademark cases are decided. Expert audiences are likely to evaluate infringement based on the technical similarity between the plaintiff\u2019s and defendant\u2019s works. Consumers, by contrast, are likely to pay more attention to market substitution and less attention to how things work under the hood. Understanding the different audiences in IP infringement is critical to understanding how the IP regimes define infringement. \n As a normative matter, the authors argue that IP infringement\u2014across trademark, patent, copyright, and design patent laws\u2014should generally require proof both that the two works are sufficiently similar in their novel aspects (technical similarity) and that the defendant\u2019s use interferes with the plaintiff\u2019s market (market substitution).

According to this critique, the over-expansion of IP rights throughout the past two decades harms competition, chills free speech, and diminishes the public domain as increasingly broad areas of social life are brought within the scope of strong IP protection. While this over-expansion theory reflects an important - indeed, foundational - policy debate concerning the proper balance between IP owners' rights and the public's rights of access to the information, ideas, and expressions\nthat IP protects, it is incomplete because it focuses largely on what Congress or the courts do. In reality, most enforcement of IP rights takes place not in court, but in the everyday practices of IP owners and their lawyers. \"Cease and desist\" letters, phone calls, and negotiations with alleged infringers constitute the bulk of IP enforcement efforts in trademark and copyright practice. To be sure, these efforts take place in the \"shadow\" of IP law and are therefore influenced by it. But it is in these everyday practices - and not in trial or appellate courts - that most IP rights are asserted, resisted, and negotiated. Thus, if we want to know whether IP rights are over-enforced or over-extended, we need to know how, why, and to what effect these\nrights are exercised in the everyday practices of IP owners and their lawyers. To date, however, IP scholarship has focused virtually no attention on this critical arena of everyday practice. This Article presents findings from a qualitative empirical study of the trademark and copyright disputing process outside of court, based on original data derived from semi-structured interviews with experienced\nIP attorneys who advise clients on how to enforce their rights. This research is one of the first studies to examine how trademark and copyright claims are actually enforced in practice. One significant finding from this study is that \"repeat player\" trademark and copyright owners (and their lawyers) knowingly assert weak IP claims at times - precisely because it works, as enforcement targets are unable or unwilling to resist claims that may lack legal merit due to the costs and uncertainties of threatened litigation. Moreover, the lawyers who assert weak IP claims have ready practical and ethical justifications for their actions. This study also suggests that legal sanctions directed at deterring over-reaching IP enforcement are unlikely to be effective because most such over-reaching occurs in informal disputing processes outside of the legal system. \n Main results: \n Policy implications: \n Future empirical scholarship that focuses on IP disputing in action should build on these insights and contribute to a growing understanding of the significance of private disputing in shaping the effective scope of trademark and copyright owners\u2019 rights.", "implications": "Policy implications: \n Future empirical scholarship that focuses on IP disputing in action should build on these insights and contribute to a growing understanding of the significance of private disputing in shaping the effective scope of trademark and copyright owners\u2019 rights.", "results": "Main results: \n Policy implications: \n Future empirical scholarship that focuses on IP disputing in action should build on these insights and contribute to a growing understanding of the significance of private disputing in shaping the effective scope of trademark and copyright owners\u2019 rights."}}

A significant difference was found in the association between outcome expectations and intention to pirate software with a higher correlation obtained for individuals from IT/technical occupations.

A significant amount of literature has been published on the application of competition rules to premium content rights agreements, but the specific obstacles encountered by new media platforms have been relatively unexplored. This paper seeks to fill this gap in the literature. \n The European Commission (hereafter, the Commission) has recognised in its decisions that premium content is an \"essential input\" for operators active in the delivery of audio-visual content. There is indeed no substitution possible with other less attractive forms of content. In fact, premium content such as major football events represents \"stand-alone\" driver content for pay-TV operators. Absent access to such content it is very difficult for a content delivery operator to gain or retain market shares. Access to premium content is thus a matter of life or death for such operators. \n Yet, getting access to premium content is not an easy matter. First, premium content is scarce as there are only a few blockbusters and a limited number of premium sport events every year. Moreover, premium content rights contracts usually involve some form of exclusivity pursuant to which dominant pay-TV operators often manage to monopolize such rights for several years at the expense of weaker competitors. The combination of scarcity and exclusivity has translated into a spiralling of the costs involved in buying premium content. For instance, while in 1992, broadcasters paid 434 million euros for the TV rights of the English Premier League, in 2000, they paid 2,6 billion euros for only three seasons. \n The lack of access to premium content represents a significant handicap for new entrants, such as new media platforms. If these platforms want to gain market share, they need to show programmes, which are able to compete with the content shown by dominant pay-TV operators. Access foreclosure to premium content would thus not only prevent new entries from taking place in the highly concentrated pay-TV market, but would also affect technological developments and consumer choice as the latter would be prevented from watching their favourite programmes on the platform of their choice. Thus, in a number of policy speeches, Commission officials have insisted on the importance that new media platforms gain access to premium content. \n The main argument followed throughout the paper is that, while recent Commission decisions contain remedies, which will help new media platforms to gain access to premium content, such remedies are insufficient to create a level playing field in the market for the acquisition of such content. Numerous anti-competitive practices continue to plague this market and further competition law intervention is thus required.", "implications": "", "results": ""}}

Books, magazines, films, software and plays, as well as works of art, architecture, music, and even choreography may be protected by copyright. For works created before 1976, knowing whether a work is published is often necessary for determining whether it is in the public domain so that anyone can use it, copy it or adapt it in other media without risking copyright liability. A court\u2019s determination of whether a work is published also may be dispositive of issues such as the duration of the copyright, if others can make fair use of it and whether, in litigation, statutory damages and attorney\u2019s fees are available. Despite the obvious import of this concept, it remains one of the most ambiguous features of copyright law. How do judges decide whether a creative work is published? This article presents the first comprehensive and systematic answer to that question. Based on a dataset of federal judicial opinions, this article analyzes the extent to which accepted notions of copyright publication conform with legal doctrine. The results reveal that often they do not. In particular, this article demonstrates that publication has a surprisingly inconsistent meaning across copyright issues, differing dramatically between the public domain and fair use contexts. The analysis shows that the characteristics of the work, as well as how it is distributed and accessed are important to courts when deciding whether a work is in the public domain. These findings are especially noteworthy, since contrary to popular belief, courts increasingly encounter the issue of publication when answering a wide variety of copyright questions. Drawing upon the empirical findings, the Article recommends that the commonly used definitions of publication be changed to reflect the factors upon which judges actually rely in deciding these cases. \n Publication is still of great importance in judicial outcomes of copyright cases.  Judges treat publication in accordance with the copyright question in the case (e.g., differently in a fair use case and a public domain case).  Therefore, the current statutory definition of publication is insufficient and does not reflect the practical application and consideration of publication. \n Statutory changes should be made to more accurately reflect judicial and practical applications of publication.", "implications": "Statutory changes should be made to more accurately reflect judicial and practical applications of publication.", "results": "Publication is still of great importance in judicial outcomes of copyright cases.

Electronic used book exchanges, in particular, offer a\nwider selection, lower search costs, and significantly lower prices than physical used bookstores\ndo. The increased viability of these used book markets has caused concern among groups such as\nthe Book Publishers Association and Author\u2019s Guild who believe that used book markets will\nsignificantly cannibalize new book sales.\nThis proposition, while theoretically possible, is based on speculation as opposed to empirical\nevidence. In this research, we use a unique dataset collected from Amazon.com\u2019s new and used\nmarketplaces to estimate the impact of IT-enabled used book markets on new book sales. We use\nthese data to calculate the impact of these secondary market exchanges on consumer and publisher\nwelfare by calculating the cross-price elasticity of new books sales with respect to used\nbook prices.\nOur analysis suggests that IT-enabled secondary market exchanges increase consumer surplus by\napproximately $70 million annually. Further, we find that only 15% of used book sales at Amazon\ncannibalize new book purchases. The remaining 85% of used book sales apparently would\nnot have occurred at Amazon\u2019s new book prices. This low cannibalization means that book publishers\nlose only $32 million in gross profit annually (about 0.2% of total gross profit) due to the\npresence of Amazon\u2019s used book markets. Further, the additional used book readership gain\nfrom these electronic markets may mitigate author losses through increased revenue from secondary\nsources such as speaking and licensing fees. These surplus changes, combined with the estimated\n$64 million the used book market added to Amazon\u2019s gross profits, show that IT-enabled\nused markets for books have a strong positive first-order impact on total welfare. \n In this research, the authors analyze the impact of used book markets on new book sales at Amazon.com. They find that the while 29.9 million used book sales took place in 2002 on Amazon.com\u2019s site, only 4.5 million of these sales cannibalized new book sales. The remaining sales apparently would not have occurred at Amazon\u2019s new book price.

We use data from the Apple iTunes country stores in 27 EU Member States to measure geographical market segmentation in supply (availability), demand (sales) and prices across the EU for downloadable digital music and film. We find that availability of EU media products across country stores in the EU is hovering around 80% for music and 40% for films. Recent industry initiatives to reduce the transaction costs of making digital music available across borders have resulted in a reasonably wide availability though still short of the 100% mark. Consumer preference variables such as cultural proximity, a shared language or border and inherent preferences for home market products are the main drivers for the observed geographical market segmentation in demand patterns, both for music and film. Supply side factors including copyright-related trade costs probably still play a role in music though we can only infer this indirectly in the absence of data on copyright licensing arrangements at product level. Commercial strategies and territorial restrictions in distribution agreements reduce film availability, more so than copyright issues.

And yet IP is everywhere. Even a simple coffee jar relies on a range of IP rights \u2013 from patents to copyright, designs to trade marks.\n In the modern world, knowledge capital, more than physical capital, drives the UK economy. Against the backdrop of the increasing importance of ideas, IP rights, which protect their value, are more vital than ever. The ideal IP system creates incentives for innovation, without unduly limiting access for consumers and follow on innovators. It must strike the right balance in a rapidly changing world so that innovators can see further by standing on the shoulders of giants.\n The Government\u2019s decision to commission this Review was an explicit recognition both of the growing importance of IP and of the challenges brought by the changing economic environment. In commissioning the Review, the Chancellor and the Secretaries of State for Trade and Industry, and Culture, Media and Sport asked me to establish whether the system was fit for purpose in an era of globalisation, digitisation and increasing economic specialisation.\n The answer is a qualified \u2018yes\u2019. I do not think the system is in need of radical overhaul. However, taking a holistic view of the system, I believe there is scope for reform to serve better the interests of consumers and industry alike. There are three areas in which the Review concentrates its recommendations to improve the UK framework for innovation:\n \u2022 strengthening enforcement of IP rights, whether through clamping down on piracy or trade in\ncounterfeit goods;\n\u2022 reducing costs of registering and litigating IP rights for businesses large and small; and\n\u2022 improving the balance and flexibility of IP rights to allow individuals, businesses and institutions to use\ncontent in ways consistent with the digital age.\n Much IP policy is framed by European, and indeed global, treaties and agreements. I recognise that not all the recommendations are within the direct purview of the UK Government. However, I have not shied away from making recommendations with European or broader international import when they seemed necessary. Indeed, with the European Commission currently reviewing both the copyright acquis and the question of a Community patent, this is a timely point at which to put forward the Review\u2019s arguments. \n I would like to express my thanks to all those who assisted me in producing this Review. Many individuals and organisations gave generously of their time to contribute insights, and in particular the great diversity and depth of responses to the Call for Evidence were invaluable. I owe a special debt to the Review team, who have supported me throughout: Richard Sargeant, Steve Coles, Alastair Cowie, Suzy Kantor, Nicola Kay, Stephen Rowan and Nathan Sansom.\n I hope this Review provides sound recommendations on how the IP regime should respond to the challenges that it faces. Getting the balance right is vital to driving innovation, securing investment and stimulating competition. Lasting success will belong to those who get this right. \n \"The Review found the current system to be broadly performing satisfactorily. However, there are a number of areas where reform is necessary to improve the system for all its users. The Review therefore sets out a range of pragmatic recommendations, which can be grouped around three themes: first, stronger enforcement of rights; second, lower costs for business; and finally, balanced and flexible rights.\"\n From these conclusions the review makes a considerable number of policy recommendations which can be found below. \n The review states the following about instruments of Intellectual Property (IP); patents, copyright, trade marks and designs.\n \u2022 balance; the instruments should ensure that the incentive to innovate is balanced against the ability of follow-on innovators to access knowledge.\n \u2022 coherence; the instruments should be clear and consistent; the scope of rights should not change retrospectively in order to ensure trust in the system; and the international system should promote innovation in all countries.\n \u2022 flexibility; the instruments should be flexible in order to respond to the changing economic environment and the needs of rights holders and users.\n The Review has made a number of recommendations to improve the framework for innovation; in particular it has called for:\n \u2022 stronger enforcement of IP rights to ensure practical protection is provided for rights owners and effective deterrents to infringement are in place.\n \u2022 lower operational costs for business, simplifying processes such as licensing and litigation, and improving education and advice.\n \u2022 greater balance and flexibility of IP rights to allow individuals, businesses and institutions to use information and ideas in ways consistent with the digital age.\n Specific to copyright the review made the following key recommendations:", "implications": "The review states the following about instruments of Intellectual Property (IP); patents, copyright, trade marks and designs.\n \u2022 balance; the instruments should ensure that the incentive to innovate is balanced against the ability of follow-on innovators to access knowledge.\n \u2022 coherence; the instruments should be clear and consistent; the scope of rights should not change retrospectively in order to ensure trust in the system; and the international system should promote innovation in all countries.\n \u2022 flexibility; the instruments should be flexible in order to respond to the changing economic environment and the needs of rights holders and users.\n The Review has made a number of recommendations to improve the framework for innovation; in particular it has called for:\n \u2022 stronger enforcement of IP rights to ensure practical protection is provided for rights owners and effective deterrents to infringement are in place.\n \u2022 lower operational costs for business, simplifying processes such as licensing and litigation, and improving education and advice.\n \u2022 greater balance and flexibility of IP rights to allow individuals, businesses and institutions to use information and ideas in ways consistent with the digital age.\n Specific to copyright the review made the following key recommendations:", "results": "\"The Review found the current system to be broadly performing satisfactorily.

This rationale is empirically tested through a dual empirical strategy, that is, a market survey and a laboratory experiment.

[1]\n \nAbstract: We inductively develop a model of the commercialization process for new products or services user entrepreneurs undertake when entering an industry while drawing on proprietary technology developed in another industry. Extending the growing field of user entrepreneurship, we identify a two-phase approach to industry entry by user entrepreneurs who start \u201cunder the radar\u201d of incumbent firms, gain experience, attract a first potential customer base, and then, in a second phase, engage in commercialization. During this process, a community of fellow users is of major importance for the entrepreneur, serving as a knowledge pool for skills development and experimentation with different commercialization paths. We study a nascent group of firms founded by users of video games who became entrepreneurs on entering the animation industry by producing Machinima, a new film genre characterized by shooting film in video games.

Unauthorized copying has ambiguous consequences: on the one hand, it affects the extent to which suppliers of reproducible creative works can appropriate the value of these intangible goods; on the other hand, unauthorized copying has increased competition between suppliers of creative works, and is associated with substantial productivity increases. Contrary to common expectations, our empirical evidence suggests that digital retailing is not associated with disintermediation and has not made the market for recorded music more contestable. Furthermore, the market power of Internet-based intermediaries can undermine the appropriability of creators, which has not yet been acknowledged in debates on copyright reforms. In this context, copyright policy that focuses on controlling unauthorized use can be ineffective. It needs to be complemented by regulation that limits the market power of digital retailers.", "implications": "", "results": ""}}

Indeed, the economic literature explains why without such organisations, copyright law would be ineffective in some markets for copyrighted works: the majority of authors and users would not be able to grant or obtain permission to use many works of art, literature, music, film and other such works that copyright law protects. In economic terms, CCS enable markets to function for the use of copyright works in situations in which the copyright holder cannot contract directly with the user. But because many markets for copyright works have changed rapidly over recent years, we should ask under which circumstances CCS would continue to play a constructive, maybe even essential, role. It has been argued many times that technical solutions to digital rights management (DRM) will render CCS obsolete as the market for copyrights shifts online and policy-makers such as the European Commission have begun to scrutinise the role played by CCS in the dynamic market for copyrighted media content online (REC 2005/737/EC).

The present report shows that substantially more musical works and movies have been released in recent years than before the diffusion of digital copying technology. At the same time, the average quality of these works has been stable according to user assessments. Countries with stronger copyright protection do not exhibit greater supply of new works. Accordingly, the relatively strict copyright protection in some countries does not seem to promote the supply of new creative works. The present report also considers whether user-generated content (UGC) complements or substitutes professional content. An increasing supply of valuable UGC is not reflected in official economic statistics. In all probability, copyright protection promotes user-generated content less than professional content. As a result, substituting professional content with \"amateur material\" could reduce the socially desirable strength of copyright protection. However, we find that almost half of all works available on YouTube are professional content. Professional works are watched and recommended more frequently than the average. In addition, a large proportion of UGC on YouTube draws on professional works. There is little evidence that professional content would be widely replaced. It follows that UGC could also be supported by an efficient copyright system, which strengthens the supply of professional content without excessively limiting its further use as input for UGC.", "implications": "", "results": ""}}

Although this problem is certainly not limited to digital libraries, it has proven especially challenging for these organizations because they hold diverse collections that include millions of books, articles, letters, photographs, home movies, films, and other types of works. Many items come with a complex, unknown, and (often) unknowable history of copyright ownership. Because U.S. copyright law provides for both strong injunctive relief and monetary damages (in the form of statutory damages of up to $150,000 per work infringed), organizations that cannot obtain permission often do not make their collections available at all.\n In October 2012, the U.S. Copyright Office initiated a new study of orphan works and mass digitization, and has indicated that it is a high-priority policy issue for the office. That study, and the work that preceded it, has highlighted the wide array of perspectives about why and how to address the orphan works problem. In this article, we present evidence that the orphan works problem is very real and that it inhibits many socially valuable uses of copyrighted works by libraries, archives, museums and other memory institutions. We then canvass the array of potential solutions, and ultimately conclude that fair use, combined with the Copyright Office\u2019s remedy limitation approach, are better approaches for addressing this problem in the United States than alternatives proposed elsewhere. Finally, we explore future-looking changes, such as the reintroduction of copyright formalities and the development of registries, that would reduce the number of orphan works in the future.", "implications": "", "results": ""}}

These approaches usually attempt to address the orphan works problem by employing some threshold mechanism to differentiate true orphan works, to which the proposed solutions would apply, from non-orphaned copyrighted works.

This paper examines in detail the core schemes for identifying rightsholders among the leading orphan works regimes and proposals.

Moral consideration is one factor that might sway individuals to pay for files they could otherwise obtain for free. To help better understand how moral consideration works in the context of file sharing, this research examines how people form perceptions of the legality and ethicalness of downloading music files through file sharing. We propose that when people receive files in a more restrictive manner (e.g. streaming vs. downloading) they are less likely to recognize file sharing as being unethical or illegal. We conduct five studies to test our theory of restrictiveness. The results consistently indicate that consumers\u2019 perceptions of legality and ethicalness of file sharing are associated with restrictiveness of use. In particular, while file sharing with different levels of restrictiveness still transfers intellectual property from one individual to another, increased restrictiveness results in consumers being less likely to identify file sharing as being illegal or unethical. This in turn has a great impact on their actual engagement in the unauthorized file sharing activities. We find the relationships are significant even when controlling for several other elements such as gender, age, income, and prior knowledge about how and where to go on the internet to participate in file sharing. \n Main results of studies:\n Policy implications:", "implications": "Policy implications:", "results": "Main results of studies:\n Policy implications:"}}

Therefore, in contrast with the case of more intensive copyright enforcement, more extensive copyright enforcement over some range can increase the incentive to generate intellectual property while also reducing the loss to consumers from monopoly power. \n Broad-based and targeted copyright enforcement have very different implications for firm pricing strategies, piracy and social welfare.

The Review was needed, the PM said, because of the risk that the current intellectual property framework might not be sufficiently well designed to promote innovation and growth in the UK economy.\n In the five months we have had to compile the Review, we have sought never to lose sight of David Cameron\u2019s \u201cexam question\u201d. Could it be true that laws designed more than three centuries ago with the express purpose of creating economic incentives for innovation by protecting creators\u2019 rights are today obstructing innovation and economic growth?\n The short answer is: yes. We have found that the UK\u2019s intellectual property framework, especially with regard to copyright, is falling behind what is needed. Copyright, once the exclusive concern of authors and their publishers, is today preventing medical researchers studying data and text in pursuit of new treatments. Copying has become basic to numerous industrial processes, as well as to a burgeoning service economy based upon the internet. The UK cannot afford to let a legal framework designed around artists impede vigorous participation in these emerging business sectors.\n This does not mean, however, that we must put our hugely important creative industries at risk. Indeed, these businesses too need change, in the form of more open, contestable and effective global markets in digital content and a setting in which enforcement of copyright becomes effective once more.\n The Review sets out how this can be achieved. We have focused upon the main issues, at the risk of ignoring important points of detail, and have tried to set out a clear, strategic argument, supported with just ten recommendations. We are also making available online a number of documents which explore the available evidence and submissions made to the Review. If the Review\u2019s recommendations are followed, the result will be more innovation and more economic growth.\n Our intellectual property framework will face further significant pressure to adapt in the coming years, as we make our way into the third decade of the commercial internet. We urge Government to ensure that in future, policy on Intellectual Property issues is constructed on the basis of evidence, rather than weight of lobbying, and to ensure that the institutions upon which we depend to deliver intellectual property policy have clear mandates and adaptive capability. Without that, the pile of IP reviews on the Government\u2019s doorstep \u2013 four in the last six years \u2013 will continue to accumulate. \n The review made 10 main policy recommendations that can be found below. \n This review (widely referred to as Hargreaves Review) makes 10 distinct policy recommendations. A number of these a concerned largely with issues surrounding patent law. However, the majority are relevant to copyright policy.\n 1. Evidence: Government should ensure that development of the IP System is driven as far as possible by objective evidence. Policy should balance measurable economic objectives against social goals and potential benefits for rights holders against impacts on consumers and other interests. These concerns will be of particular importance in assessing future claims to extend rights or in determining desirable limits to rights.\n 2. International priorities: The UK should resolutely pursue its international interests in IP, particularly with respect to emerging economies such as China and India, based upon positions grounded in economic evidence. It should attach the highest immediate priority to achieving a unified EU patent court and EU patent system, which promises significant economic benefits to UK business. The UK should work to make the Patent Cooperation Treaty a more effective vehicle for international processing of patent applications.\n 3. Copyright licensing:\n\u2022 In order to boost UK firms\u2019 access to transparent, contestable and global digital markets, the UK should establish a cross sectoral Digital Copyright Exchange. Government should appoint a senior figure to oversee its design and implementation by the end of 2012. A range of incentives and disincentives will be needed to encourage rights holders and others to take part. Governance should reflect the interests of participants, working to an agreed code of practice.\n\u2022 The UK should support moves by the European Commission to establish a framework for cross border copyright licensing, with clear benefits to the UK as a major exporter of copyright works. Collecting societies should be required by law to adopt codes of practice, approved by the IPO and the UK competition authorities, to ensure that they operate in a way that is consistent with the further development of efficient, open markets.\n 4. Orphan works: The Government should legislate to enable licensing of orphan works. This should establish extended collective licensing for mass licensing of orphan works, and a clearance procedure for use of individual works. In both cases, a work should only be treated as an orphan if it cannot be found by search of the databases involved in the proposed Digital Copyright Exchange.\n 5. Limits to copyright: Government should firmly resist over regulation of activities which do not prejudice the central objective of copyright, namely the provision of incentives to creators. Government should deliver copyright exceptions at national level to realise all the opportunities within the EU framework, including format shifting, parody, non-commercial research, and library archiving. The UK should also promote at EU level an exception to support text and data analytics. The UK should give a lead at EU level to develop a further copyright exception designed to build into the EU framework adaptability to new technologies. This would be designed to allow uses enabled by technology of works in ways which do not directly trade on the underlying creative and expressive purpose of the work. The Government should also legislate to ensure that these and other copyright exceptions are protected from override by contract.\n 6. Patent thickets and other obstructions to innovation: In order to limit the effects of these barriers to innovation, the Government should:\n\u2022 take a leading role in promoting international efforts to cut backlogs and manage the boom in patent applications by further extending \u201cwork sharing\u201d with patent offices in other countries;\n\u2022 work to ensure patents are not extended into sectors, such as non-technical computer programs and business methods, which they do not currently cover, without clear evidence of benefit;\n\u2022 investigate ways of limiting adverse consequences of patent thickets, including by working with international partners to establish a patent fee structure set by reference to innovation and growth goals rather than solely by reference to patent office running costs. The structure of patent renewal fees might be adjusted to encourage patentees to assess more carefully the value of maintaining lower value patents, so reducing the density of patent thickets.\n 7. The design industry: The role of IP in supporting this important branch of the creative economy has been neglected. In the next 12 months, the IPO should conduct an evidence based assessment of the relationship between design rights and innovation, with a view to establishing a firmer basis for evaluating policy at the UK and European level. The assessment should include exploration with design interests of whether access to the proposed Digital Copyright Exchange would help creators protect and market their designs and help users better achieve legally compliant access to designs.\n 8. Enforcement of IP rights: The Government should pursue an integrated approach based upon enforcement, education and, crucially, measures to strengthen and grow legitimate markets in copyright and other IP protected fields. When the enforcement regime set out in the DEA becomes operational next year its impact should be carefully monitored and compared with experience in other countries, in order to provide the insight needed to adjust enforcement mechanisms as market conditions evolve. This is urgent and Ofcom should not wait until then to establish its benchmarks and begin building data on trends. In order to support rights holders in enforcing their rights the Government should introduce a small claims track for low monetary value IP claims in the Patents County Court.\n 9. Small firm access to IP advice: The IPO should draw up plans to improve accessibility of the IP system to smaller companies who will benefit from it. This should involve access to lower cost providers of integrated IP legal and commercial advice.\n 10. An IP system responsive to change: The IPO should be given the necessary powers and mandate in law to ensure that it focuses on its central task of ensuring that the UK\u2019s IP system promotes innovation and growth through efficient, contestable markets. It should be empowered to issue statutory opinions where these will help clarify copyright law. As an element of improved transparency and adaptability, Government should ensure that by the end of 2013, the IPO publishes an assessment of the impact of those measures advocated in this review which have been accepted by Government.", "implications": "This review (widely referred to as Hargreaves Review) makes 10 distinct policy recommendations.

Specifically, does it matter if the source of advice has a stake in the outcome of the piracy decision? Does it matter if the source of advice has a social tie with the advisee? Accordingly, we conduct a laboratory experiment using teenagers and their parents as subjects, increasing the realism of the context by sampling potential pirates and their parents. Treatments represent various sources of piracy advice (e.g., the teen's parent, a record label, or an external regulator). Subjects make decisions playing our new experimental game\u2014The Piracy Game\u2014extended from the volunteer's dilemma literature. Interestingly, subjects respond negatively to advice from record labels over time, purchasing fewer songs as compared to other sources such as the subject's parent. The existence of a social tie between the adviser and the subject assists in mitigating piracy, especially when a parent is facing potential penalties due to his or her child's behavior. An external regulator, having no social tie or stake in the decision, provides the least credible source of advice, leading to the greatest amount of piracy. Our analyses not only provide managerial insights but also develop theoretical understanding of the role of social ties in the context of advice. \n - Digital good providers have tried various approaches to educate potential pirates about the implications of piracy to encourage them to purchase. Yet, there is little analysis done on the implication of the educational strategies. To fill this gap, this paper investigates the implications of the source of advice on both pirating and purchasing decisions. The study is among the first to include both parents and their children in a behavioral/experimental economics study.\n - Results indicate that when there is a tangible stake for the parent for their child\u2019s actions, purchasing behavior by the child is significantly increased, and pirating behavior is slightly decreased.\n - Even when there is not a stake for the parents (e.g., potential litigation), the advice is most effective when the advisor has a stronger social tie (parent as opposed to the record label or a regulator). On the contrary, when the record label provides advice, the profit generated surprisingly results in the worst outcome. \n Although the industry is attempting to shift to education strategies (e.g., Pyyny, 2003; RIAA, 2009, 2011a,b; Stewart-Robertson, 2010), in lieu of litigation (or technology controls for that matter), the current status quo of sending advice directly from 3rd parties could certainly be improved by coordinating advice through channels with greater social ties to the pirates.", "implications": "Although the industry is attempting to shift to education strategies (e.g., Pyyny, 2003; RIAA, 2009, 2011a,b; Stewart-Robertson, 2010), in lieu of litigation (or technology controls for that matter), the current status quo of sending advice directly from 3rd parties could certainly be improved by coordinating advice through channels with greater social ties to the pirates.", "results": "- Digital good providers have tried various approaches to educate potential pirates about the implications of piracy to encourage them to purchase.

However, the most of technological protection measures used so far were quickly circumvented after their introduction. This led to the development and use of more and more advanced technological protection measures, which were also quickly circumvented after their introduction. Therefore, the conventional view on the efficiency of using technological protection measures is that their use leads to a vicious circle of their circumvention and upgrading. \n To examine the efficiency of technological protection measures, we conducted an online survey in Japan. A random sample of 1,252 internet users was asked to respond to a series of multiple-choice questions on their consumption of copyrighted works and their acceptance of or objection to selected restrictions on various uses of copyrighted works. By analyzing collected data, we identified that an individual\u2019s decision on the acceptance or rejection of such technological and other restrictions on using copyrighted works is affected by factors such as gender, type of copyrighted works, perception of justified use, and actual use of copyright works. In addition, we observed considerable differences between the importance of individual types of copyrighted works and their uses for consumers. Some types of copyrighted works and their uses were more important for respondents than others. In many cases, the respondents\u2019 judgments were consistent with the current copyright law and practice in Japan. However, there are several significant issues where their judgment considerably differs, especially with regard to recent changes in Japanese copyright law aiming to strengthen copyright enforcement in the digital environment. This can considerably undermine the efficiency of those changes in copyright law.", "implications": "", "results": ""}}

Software piracy is one prevalent type of cybercrime and has detrimentally affected the economic health of the software industry. Moreover, piracy arguably represents a rend in the moral fabric associated with the respect of intellectual property and reduces the financial incentive of product creation and innovation. Deindividuation theory, originating from the field of social psychology, argues that individuals are extricated from responsibility for their actions simply because they no longer have an acute awareness of the identity of self and of others. That is, external and internal constraints that would typically regulate questionable behavior are rendered less effective via certain anonymizing and disinhibiting conditions of the social and environmental context. This exploratory piece seeks to establish the role of deindividuation in liberating individuals to commit software piracy by testing the hypothesis that persons who prefer the anonymity and pseudonymity associated with interaction on the Internet are more likely to pirate software. Through this research, it is hoped that the empirical identification of such a social psychological determinant will help further illuminate the phenomenon. \n This article intends to obtain a greater understanding of the factors that influence the commission of software piracy.

Therefore, this study examined whether low self-control and deviant peer associations explained various forms of cyberdeviance in a youth sample. We also tested whether associating with deviant peers mediated the effect of low self-control on cyberdeviance as well as whether it conditioned the effect.

Although researchers have explored social interactions in the real world, few have considered how learning occurs through virtual interactions. We address the role of on-line interactions in spreading subcultural knowledge by interviewing 34 persistent digital pirates and performing a non-participant ethnography of an on-line forum devoted to piracy. Our results show that through on-line interactions, pirates learn the norms and values of digital piracy, including how to recognize and avoid risks associated with pirating and how to make sense of and justify their actions. They did not see themselves as members of a piracy subculture, however. These findings show that subcultural knowledge can be transmitted through on-line interactions, even when participants do not fully invest in the group. \n Media pirates within hacker subculture share the belief that information should be shared and that illegal downloading is due to bad practices of record companies and does not harm the artist.  While they are aware of legal sanctions, these threats do not play a significant role in decision making.

The difference-in-difference kernel matching (DDM) method directly quantifies the effect. I find that the quarterly music expenditure of the average\nU.S. household has declined by two dollars and forty-six cents as a result of using the Internet and plausibly Napster. This accounts for 33% of the decrease in total recording sales in 2000. The second approach estimates a demand system for entertainment goods. The estimated cross-price elasticities imply that changes in prices of other entertainment goods also explain the slump in recorded music sales. In 2000, roughly 37% of the decline in recording sales is due to such changes in prices. The final method constructs synthetic cohorts. The results indicate that transition from LPs to CDs might describe the increase in music sales during the 1990\u2019s as well as the recent slowdown. These two other methods\nindirectly measure the effect of Napster in that they explicate that more than 80% of music sales decrease in 2000 might have resulted from factors aside from Napster. This implies that the estimated magnitude using DDM may quantify changes in the household-level music expenditure due to not only Napster but also factors other than file-sharing of copyrighted music. \n One fundamental premise of copyright protection is that it secures revenues of copyright holders and the related industry by prohibiting unauthorized copies of music.

This article analyses digitisation within cultural institutions in light of the Digital Agenda reforms of 2000 and the Copyright Amendment Act 2006 (Cth). Copyright law can have a significant impact on digitisation practices, particularly with regard to digitising audiovisual material and orphan works, and in relation to digital access: that is, the public availability of digital content. Research suggests that, for the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) (Copyright Act) to work on its own terms, some small-scale reforms are required. However, the research also underscores larger questions about the sustainability of existing copyright law and practice.

Addressing this issue in the context of recorded music, we develop and test hypotheses from theoretical models of end-user and re-seller piracy on international panel data for music CDs. Empirically, we find that the demand for music CDs decreased with piracy, suggesting that \"theft\" outweighed the \"positive\" effects of piracy. However, the impact of piracy on CD sales was considerably smaller than industry estimates. Further, we estimated that, accounting for both demand losses and price adjustments, the industry lost no more than 6.6% of revenue to piracy. \n Main results: \n Policy implications:", "implications": "Policy implications:", "results": "Main results: \n Policy implications:"}}

The emerging production ecology that involves new kinds of distributed organisations and ad-hoc networks epitomises the \u2018drift of value\u2019 from producer to consumer and allows us to understand how user-led innovation influences the creative industries. But the ability to control intellectual property rights in content production is critical to the power structures and social dynamic that are being created in this space. Trainz, a train simulation game released by Brisbane developer Auran, which relies heavily on fan created content for its success is used as a case study. The licence agreements between Auran and the fan\ncreators are analysed in order to understand how the balance between the commercial and non-commercial is achieved and how the tension between open networks of collaboration and closed structures of commercial competitive environments are negotiated. It explains the intellectual property issues involved and highlights how the interface between copyright and contract will have a critical impact on this example of user led innovation. \n The great challenge in this environment in the next few years will be over who controls the IP \u2013 a complex mosaic of rights in the digital estate \u2013 and how.

Auran provide an interesting approach which is responsive to the needs of the fan developers and in most respects provides a best practice model. That cannot be said for all platform owners.

IP is a set of conventions and legal practices which evolved in a very different environment of production and distribution. In a co-creative social networking site we find a concatenation of amateurs, semiprofessionals and professionals, occupying multiple roles in gifting economies, reputation economies, monetised charitable economies and full commercial economies. People use, buy, sell, give away, and consume in this mixed economy that can be characterised as a 'social network market'. The users of online social networking sites (SNS) find themselves having to come to grips with the complexity of IP law in order to participate fully. This paper uses Ravelry, a specialist SNS for knitters and spinners, to analyse the negotiations that take place around IP in a social network market, in particular the way the discourse of copyright is mobilised to negotiate the territory between amateurs and professionals. \n Copyright and intellectual property are not completely irrelevant as mechanisms of regulation, but there is a problem if a regulatory mechanism is in play that most people have very poor literacy\nwith, and in fact even most trained legal people admit to uncertainty over. If a simple request for clarification generates a thread with over 80 posts and almost inevitably ends with \u201cyou need to consult an attorney\u201d, then there is a problem. While discussion leads to some literacy, in fact the general effect seems to be off-putting rather than encouraging of people learning more.\nIn the resulting confusions moral rather than legal discourses seem to drive some of the decisions made to publish or not, even though negotiations are couched around copyright. The frictions between amateurs and professionals, or the social and financial economies of a social network market, are played out on the field of IP. \nThe Ravelry site owners are in the process of designing some standard Creative Commons style licenses for designers to use if they choose, but acknowledge that these will not fulfill the\nneeds of all designers in all jurisdictions. They are partly hoping that the licenses will serve an educational function for buyers by making clear what they are able to do with the patterns they are either purchasing or being given for free. The Ravelry standard licenses, if they eventuate, will serve some different purposes to the CC licenses. CC licenses are designed to give users a larger set of permissions than copyright, in advance, thus obviating the\nneed for a user to contact the owner for those permissions. Ravelry licenses may serve a similar function but some classes will serve to limit rather than expand the permissions, and will thus require a click through style of consent to the contractual arrangement. Without such a procedure the contracts would not be considered valid by a court. \n The broader issues implied through this case study are about the need both for simplification and\nflexibility in intellectual property law and the need for developing new literacies in legal matters in communities of users.

While some broadcasters \u2013 especially those in developing economies - still utilise traditional analogue transmission techniques, most have transitioned to more efficient and powerful digital means of sending their programming to viewers. Use of digital technologies has enabled explosive growth in the number of channels and choices of programmes offered. It has also ceded more control to the viewer, allowing on-demand access to programming \u2013 not only from broadcasters and pay TV service providers, but also increasingly from online video services delivered over the open Internet. Indeed, as this report outlines, the definitional boundaries between broadcasting and other forms of digital video delivery are increasingly blurred. \n The viewer is undoubtedly a winner as a result of these developments as we move ever closer to the ultimate provision of ubiquitous choice, convenience and control. And broadcasters are usually winners too as evidenced by the impressive global TV market growth described in this report. Inevitably, that growth and technological development is not evenly distributed geographically, and we outline some of the key regional trends in the pages that follow, as well as some more focused snapshots of the market evolution within selected countries.\n However, this report also highlights a paradox at the heart of this technological revolution; namely, that the ceding of ever more control to the viewer also inevitably means an increasing risk that broadcasters lose control of their programming. It becomes harder and harder to prevent unauthorised access to the copyrighted content that traverses the globe at lightning speeds as digital \u2018bits\u2019. This poses an ever greater threat to the economics of intellectual property that sustain the broadcast and related industries. \n While the viewer and broadcaster can both benefit from developing technology and access to media, digitisation can make it more difficult for the copyright owner to prevent unauthorised access intellectual property, which can present a threat to broadcasting industries.", "implications": "While the viewer and broadcaster can both benefit from developing technology and access to media, digitisation can make it more difficult for the copyright owner to prevent unauthorised access intellectual property, which can present a threat to broadcasting industries.", "results": "While the viewer and broadcaster can both benefit from developing technology and access to media, digitisation can make it more difficult for the copyright owner to prevent unauthorised access intellectual property, which can present a threat to broadcasting industries."}}

Using data from a sample of 2,032 undergraduates from a large Midwestern university, the relevance of neutralization theory is tested via multinomial logistic regression while controlling for other theoretical predictors and demographic variables. The findings indicated that greater acceptance of the techniques associated with denial of responsibility, denial of injury, denial of victim, and appeal to higher loyalties significantly predicted moderate levels of piracy participation. Furthermore, the effect of appeals to higher loyalty on piracy was found to be conditioned by the respondent\u2019s approval of the behavior.

The new model is then tested against data obtained from college students as well as from a technological lifestyle forum. After the revisions these analyses suggested were applied, the model explained nearly 23% of the variance in the number of movies downloaded. The most important factors in this model were, among others: the drives to see many different and new movies, the social environment and its perceived attitude toward the behaviour, and the degree to which downloading has embedded itself in the daily routine. Because the Dutch government and lobbyists are superficially unclear about the current legislature, the unique opportunity existed to study the impact of knowing about legislature on the behaviour. Other results indicate an unexpected openness to an alternative film-distribution method where both the producers and the consumers get an honest deal, presenting options to release the current political and social tension without prosecuting an increasing portion of the population. \n - While downloading as a whole is an established activity, its particulars (like the knowledge state and economic interest) are still in constant shift, leading to both a habituation to downloading and an awareness of the expectations.\n - The current generation does not harbour a great amount of moral qualms about downloading movies. Added to this are the data which show that variance in the items from moral justification do not correlate significantly with changes in the number of downloads.\n - Knowledge of laws is a valued component of expected outcomes, but any direct effect on them is questionable.\n - Self-efficacy doesn't play a major role in predicting downloading behaviour. A possible reason for this is that downloading movies might not require a great amount of skill; navigating the web and exploring its possibilities is getting progressively less complex.\n - As self-efficacy and moral justification influences fade, for an increasing amount of consumers downloading becomes second nature, and an activity that for many seems like a criminal pursuit does not occupy much conscious thought in the minds of downloaders. \n As indicated in this study, the number of movies one downloads is heavily influenced by how deeply embedded the behaviour is in the daily routine. In all probability, efforts to reduce downloading movies without paying distributors need to start there.

Intellectual property has a functional effect on the creation, development and innovation of the intellectual products which improve our life. Software piracy is one of the important parts of the digital piracy problem, and according to Swinward et al. (1990), software was also the first copyrighted product that was duplicated on a large scale. BSA defined software piracy as the illegal copying, downloading, sharing, selling or installing of copyrighted software.\nIt is difficult to measure accurately the worldwide magnitude of the software piracy problem. According to the Business Software Alliance (BSA) Global Software Piracy Report, the rate of software piracy in 2009 was 43%. This is a serious problem for the world economy, but the problem is more serious in Turkey. According to the BSA 2009 Global Software Piracy Report, the software piracy rate in Turkey was 63% in 2009. If the assumption is made that every instance of pirated software usage equals an amount of loss in the economy, then the impact of the loss on the Turkish economy was 415 million dollars. Before advanced technology and high speed Internet, software piracy was carried out by copying disks or other types of physical objects, but now almost all types of software piracy occur over the Internet.\nThe aim of this study is to explore the factors that contribute to pirated software usage among Turkish Internet users in order to define the dynamics behind the problem of software piracy from the Internet users\u2019 perspective. Definition of the reasons behind an existing problem is a crucial part of the problem solving process. With this study the factors behind the problem of pirated software usage will be empirically analyzed from the users\u2019 perspective by applying Routine Activity Theory. According to RAT, three major factors that affect criminal activities include access to suitable targets, motivated offenders and the absence of capable guardians. According to the routine activity approach, crime or the risk of crime increases when a motivated offender identifies or encounters a suitable target in the absence of a capable guardian.", "implications": "", "results": ""}}

In this article, we trace the origins of this provision to a conceptual shift that took place during the early 1800s. Specific regulations of the book trade were superseded by the protection of all instantiations (such as performances, translations and adaptations) of abstract authored work. For two seminal copyright acts of the period, the Prussian Act of 1837 and the UK Act of 1842, we show there was considerable concern about the economic implications of this new justificatory paradigm, reflected in a period of experimentation with sophisticated registration requirements. We indicate market responses to these requirements and plea for a reconsideration of \u201cformalities\u201d as redressing justificatory problems of copyright in the digital environment. \n After re-assessing the economic rationale for the registration requirement, registration is suggested as a policy option in the context of contemporary copyright laws under pressure from digitization.\nWe have identified some sophisticated registration systems pioneered in theearly 19th century context when a dramatic conceptual shift took place away from specific regulations of printing towards a broad protection of abstract works.

As an economic burden, however, it was not very onerous.

I examine the effects of U.S. copyright piracy during a period when the U.S. was itself a developing country. U.S. statutes since 1790 protected the copyrights of American citizens, but until 1891 deemed the works of foreign citizens to be in the public domain. In 1891, the laws were changed to allow foreigners to obtain copyright protection in the United States if certain conditions were met. Thus, this episode in American history provides us with a convenient way of investigating the consequences of international copyright piracy. My analysis is based on copyright registrations, information on authors, book titles and prices, financial data from the accounts of a major publishing company, and lawsuits regarding copyright questions. These data are used to investigate the welfare effects of widespread infringement of foreign works on American publishers, writers, and the public.

Copyright hinders creativity. These statements reflect the contested nature of copyright, today more than ever before. The last twenty years have seen rapid advancements in digital technologies and information and communication systems. These advancements have had profound effects on creative activities: the process of production, dissemination, exploitation and consumption of creative output has changed; opportunities for novel ways and forms of creation, representation and manipulation of information have arisen; and, the attitudes and behaviour of creators and consumers of creative output and a host of intermediary participants in the process have transformed. As a result, copyright law has faced considerable and persistent practical challenges in adapting its contours to the digital environment. More importantly, the role of copyright, as a framework for regulating creative activities, has also come under scrutiny. \n What then is the role of copyright law in the everyday context of new and emerging creative activities -- that are borne out of the very copying and distribution technologies that have challenged copyright? How do the creative practitioners involved in such activities relate to copyright law? This chapter explores the interaction between copyright and the everyday life of artists in the digital environment. It focuses on the role of copyright in the every day context of a specific creative activity: digital art practice. It draws upon the findings from a qualitative empirical study, consisting of in-depth interviews with digital artists in the UK and Ireland, to peer \u2018through the looking glass\u2019 at the perspectives and practices of digital artists and finds \u2018a messy wonderland of copyright in action\u2019. A wonderland where: artists challenge and resist the law\u2019s default positions and policy\u2019s dominant presumptions, artists are informed and influenced by multiple elements and contextual factors in their process of meaning-making and decision making about copyright, and, artists face moral dilemmas and are pulled in different directions with respect to their perspectives and decisions regarding copyright.\n Section II of this chapter contextualizes the study and outlines the methodology employed. Section III and IV presents some of the findings from the study to demonstrate how the interviewees were challenging ownership and valuing authorship and illustrate how a variety of factors influenced the artists\u2019 understandings around copyright. Section V provides concluding remarks. \n The overarching perception amongst the interviewees was that copyright was \u201cindifferent\u201d to and\nnot useful for individual artists. They held very strong opinions on copyright which displayed a\ngeneral disenchantment with the purpose of copyright, as well as suspicion of copyright law,\nwhile admitting and lamenting that they may lack accurate knowledge of copyright law. Scholars\nhave argued that various types of rhetoric (copyright benefits authors, copyright exists to\nincentivize creativity, the romantic view of authorial creation, and economic analysis of\ncopyright) can be quite powerful and have been routinely used by stakeholders, other than\ncreators, to gain support for strengthening and extending intellectual property rights. The\nfindings demonstrate that the interviewees were knowledgeable of some of the critical discourse\non copyright law in the popular media and this contributed to their scepticism as to the value of\nprotection offered by copyright law to creators as well as its wider purpose. Instead of buying\ninto the rhetoric, the interviewees were questioning it. \n When laws are based on instrumentalist claims without solid real-world evidence, they risk\nlosing legitimacy. An unduly restrictive copyright system which does not meet the needs of creators or consumers, who wish to copy and use works protected by copyright, can trivialise the\nlaw for them. Similarly, copyright protection, which does not meet the needs of the creators\nwhom it aims to protect, can also lead to scepticism about the law. The interviewees\u2019 own\nmeanings and images of the law that they had internalized in their creative practice illustrates\nthat copyright law and policy in this case implied little for those whose creative practice it aimed to govern. As such, a challenge for copyright policy making is not just to increase awareness of the law and access to works for the users of the system, but to ensure that it retains the faith of those whom it primarily claims to benefit: the creators.\nThe interviewees were clearly not convinced that copyright was working for creators\u2019 benefit.\nHowever, they did not discount that it could. For the copyright system to support creativity, it\nrequires the confidence of its stakeholders, in particular the creators who \u2018must see it as appropriate, effective, fair and reasonable.\u2019 For the copyright framework to be effective in\nsupporting new and emerging creative activities, the first step could very well be to regain\nlegitimacy and confidence about its potential role and relevance amongst digital creators.", "implications": "When laws are based on instrumentalist claims without solid real-world evidence, they risk\nlosing legitimacy.

In particular, it is widely assumed that exploiters insist on \"grabbing rights\" (i.e. broadly conceived assignments of rights), that visual artists are not able to negotiate, that they are paid less and less, and that they are compelled to waive their moral rights.\nThis study suggests a much more equivocal picture. In place of a straightforward narrative of decline, the results of the survey suggest that in most fields there has been less change over the last decade than one might have expected: that, terms of exploitation are most often about the same. That is not to say that there are no discernible changes in particular occupations and media. Respondents and interviewees identify some important shifts. Perhaps surprisingly, it seems there are changes in practice that are, from the creator's perspective, both positive and negative. The most positive change is identified amongst the fine artists where half (50%) see their personal bargaining position as having improved, with only 6% perceiving a weakening. The most disturbing changes are in relation to photographers. About half of all photographers (49%) say their bargaining position has worsened, with only 22% reporting improvements. A significant percentage of photographers (40%) report an increase in assignments (compared with 6% who think they have decreased). Moreover, 24% report an increase in moral rights waivers (compared to 3% who identify a decrease), and a decline in the practice of attribution. 31% of photographers see attribution as decreasing over the last decade, and only 8% increasing. 28% say income from secondary use has decreased, while only 16% say it has decreased. \n There is a need to create an independently validated evidence base as a guide for policy makers, in particular in relationship to copyright issues in the digital environment.", "implications": "There is a need to create an independently validated evidence base as a guide for policy makers, in particular in relationship to copyright issues in the digital environment.", "results": "There is a need to create an independently validated evidence base as a guide for policy makers, in particular in relationship to copyright issues in the digital environment."}}

(2) From a user perspective purchases of protected material may take the form of a licensing contract, governing behaviour after the initial transaction.\nThus, a review of the relationship between copyright and contract law has to address both supply- and demand-side issues. On the supply side, policy concerns include whether copyright law delivers the often stated aim of securing the financial independence of creators. Particularly acute are the complaints by both creators and producers that they fail to benefit from the exponential increase in the availability of copyright materials on the Internet. On the demand side, the issue of copyright exceptions and their policy justification has become central to a number of reviews and consultations dealing with digital content. Are exceptions based on user needs or market failure? Do exceptions require financial compensation? Can exceptions be contracted out by licence agreements?\nThis report (i) reviews economic theory of contracts, value chains and transaction costs, (ii) identifies a comprehensive range of regulatory options relating to creator and user contracts, using an international comparative approach, (iii) surveys the empirical evidence on the effects of regulatory intervention, and (iv) where no evidence is available, extrapolates predicted effects from theory. \n A more formal application of the well-known principal-agent framework to the specific case of copyright constitutes the most logical first step forward for economists.", "implications": "A more formal application of the well-known principal-agent framework to the specific case of copyright constitutes the most logical first step forward for economists.", "results": "A more formal application of the well-known principal-agent framework to the specific case of copyright constitutes the most logical first step forward for economists."}}

Levy schemes exist now in 22 out of 27 Member States (with only the UK, Ireland, Malta, Cyprus and Luxembourg remaining outside). Despite their wide adoption, levy systems are little understood, both in respect of their rationale and their economic consequences. Tariffs are increasingly contested in  court, leading to a large gap between claimed and collected revenues. The European Commission has announced \u201ccomprehensive legislative action\u201d for 2012. \nThis report offers the first independent empirical assessment of the European levy system as a whole. The research consolidates the evidence on levy setting, collection and distribution; reviews the scope of consumer permissions associated with levy payments; and reports the results of three product level studies (printer/scanners, portable music/video/game devices, and tablet computers), analysing the relationship between VAT, levy tariffs and retail prices in 20 levy and  non\u0096-levy countries. \n There are dramatic differences between countries in the methodology used for identifying leviable devices, setting tariffs, and allocating beneficiaries of the levy. There are levies on blank media in 22 EU countries, on MP3 players in 18 countries, on printers in 12 countries, on personal computers in 4 countries.

The claim has pervaded copyright jurisprudence and economic analysis for over 200 years. Creative production would not take place without the incentive of artificial scarcity that copyright law provides. Authors and artists would starve.\n Professor Breyer (as he then was) wryly remarked in The Uneasy Case (1970, at 324): \u201cIt is, of course, conceivable that some prospective Miltons have given up writing after learning that Milton\u2019s daughter was destitute, but it is unlikely.\u201d\n This article surveys what the empirical data actually say about the way creators live. The argument proceeds in three steps.\n First, the relationship of copyright and contract law is conceptualised, starting from an analysis of contracts concluded in a pre-copyright environment (Milton 1667; Schiller 1791). The extent of statutory dependence is then scrutinised for typical sources of earnings of creators at the beginning of the 21st century.\n Second, empirical evidence on creator earnings in developed cultural markets is reviewed. It is shown that the bottom 50% of composers/songwriters earn less than 5% of the total income of the population of composers/songwriters; the bottom 50% of literary authors earn under 10% of total income; the bottom 50% of visual creators earn about 10% of total income. Median incomes are close to the poverty line. The top 10% of creators receive a disproportionally large share (visual creators: 45% of total income; literary authors: 65% of total income; composers/songwriters: 80% of total income).\n Finally, possible interpretations of these data in the light of Landes & Posner\u2019s \u201charmony of interest\u201d assumption (An Economic Analysis of Copyright Law, 1989) are considered and rejected. Creators (authors, performers) and investors (publishers, producers) have conflicting interests, and copyright law does not harmonise but exacerbate these.\n The article concludes that copyright law empirically fails to secure the financial independence of creators. If it works as an incentive for some, this may be based on a systematic cognitive mistake. \n Author suggests that copyright law does not matter in the context of creators earning so could be efficient to rethink the role of copyright.", "implications": "Author suggests that copyright law does not matter in the context of creators earning so could be efficient to rethink the role of copyright.", "results": "Author suggests that copyright law does not matter in the context of creators earning so could be efficient to rethink the role of copyright."}}

The rewards to best-selling writers are indeed high but as a profession, writing has remained resolutely unprosperous. \n For less than half of the 25,000 surveyed authors in Germany and the UK, writing is the main source of income. Typical earnings of professional authors are less than half of the national median wage in Germany, and one third below the national median wage in the UK. 60% of professional writers hold a second job of some kind.\n Throughout the study, we have attempted to differentiate between copyright and non-copyright earnings. We also have analysed for the first time systematically the distribution of income in a creative profession, calculating the Gini Coefficient for all earnings data collected (Gini=0: every writer earns the same/perfect equality; Gini=1: one earner earns everything/perfect inequality). \n After this study, copyright policy cannot remain the same. Still, for the purposes of this report, we have resisted drawing policy implications. Instead we have attempted to shape the raw data into a form that will allow multiple analyses. Emphasis has been given to providing context from statistical data held by governments, and from a comprehensive review of previous studies. \n 1. In 2004-05, professional UK authors (defined for the purposes of this study as those who allocate more than 50% of their time to writing) earned a median (\u2018typical\u2019) wage of \u00a312,330 (=64% of the national gross median wage). In 2005, professional German authors earned a median wage of \u20ac12,000/\u00a38,280 (=42% of the national net median wage).\n 2. Although authors\u2019 earnings are well below average, the crucial distinguishing feature is the risky nature of the profession. Writers work in winner-take-all markets. The distribution of income is highly unequal, as reflected in high Gini Coefficients: The top 10% of professional writers in the UK earn about 60% of total income (they earn at least \u00a368,200 per annum); the bottom 50% earn about 8% of total income (Gini: 0.63). In Germany, the top 10% of professional writers earn about 41% of total income (they earn at least \u20ac40,000/\u00a327,600 per annum); the bottom 50% earn about 12% of total income (Gini: 0.52). In contrast, the national Gini Coefficient for all employees in the UK is 0.33; in Germany it is 0.31.\n 3. Compared to the UK, writers\u2019 earnings are lower and less skewed in Germany. This may reflect a more regulated environment for copyright contracts in Germany. It may also reflect the globalised nature of English language markets. In the UK sample, 7.2% of professional writers earned \u00a3100,000 or more from writing (mean=\u00a3188,062). In the German sample, just 1.7% of professional writers earned \u00a3100,000 (\u20ac145,000) or more. No German writers in the sample earned more than \u00a3345,000 (\u20ac500,000).\n 4. Only 20% of UK writers earn all their income from writing. 60% of professional writers need another job to survive, both in Germany and the UK. However, UK and German writers show a distinct sociological profile. German authors are prepared to enter the market as a professional author (=allocating more than 50% of their time to writing) at a much lower median income than UK authors. UK authors also appear to have a more \u201cestablishment\u201d background. UK writers\u2019 households (including partners\u2019 earnings and income from non-writing jobs) earn almost double the amount of their German counterparts (UK writers\u2019 household mean: \u00a355,620; German writers\u2019 household mean: \u20ac41,644/\u00a328,734).\n 5. Income that reflects actual use of copyright works is most skewed. For UK professional authors, the Gini Coefficient for writing income is 0.63, for total individual income of writers it is 0.51, and for total household income of writers it is 0.47. For German professional authors, the Gini Coefficient for writing income is 0.52, for total individual income it is 0.43, and for total household income it is 0.42. The distribution of income for collecting society payments (which follows actual use) is more skewed than contractual writing income (which includes risk mitigating advances). The Gini Coefficient for ALCS (UK collecting society) payments to professional writers is 0.78; for VG Wort (German collecting society) payments it is 0.67. This suggests that current copyright law may exacerbate risk.\n 6. Writers who bargain with their publishers/producers earn about twice as much as those who don\u2019t (both in Germany and the UK). Compared to the UK, disputes over moral rights (the authors\u2019 rights to be credited where their work is used and to prevent its derogatory treatment) are double as likely in Germany, reflecting perhaps the \u201cinalienable\u201d legal status of these rights in Germany.\n 7. Female writers earn considerably less than male writers. The greatest gap is for main-income writers (those who earn at least 50% of their income from writing): UK female main-income writers earn 59% of male average (mean) earnings; German female main-income writers earn 69.5% of male average (mean) earnings.\n 8. Increased exploitation and use of copyright works through the Internet has not translated into increased earnings of writers. Only 14.7% of professional UK writers and 9.2% of German writers have received specific payments for Internet uses of their works. The typical earnings of authors have deteriorated since 2000, both in the UK and Germany. \n For the purposes of this report, the authors have resisted drawing policy implications.

In 2004-05, professional UK authors (defined for the purposes of this study as those who allocate more than 50% of their time to writing) earned a median (\u2018typical\u2019) wage of \u00a312,330 (=64% of the national gross median wage). In 2005, professional German authors earned a median wage of \u20ac12,000/\u00a38,280 (=42% of the national net median wage).\n 2. Although authors\u2019 earnings are well below average, the crucial distinguishing feature is the risky nature of the profession. Writers work in winner-take-all markets. The distribution of income is highly unequal, as reflected in high Gini Coefficients: The top 10% of professional writers in the UK earn about 60% of total income (they earn at least \u00a368,200 per annum); the bottom 50% earn about 8% of total income (Gini: 0.63). In Germany, the top 10% of professional writers earn about 41% of total income (they earn at least \u20ac40,000/\u00a327,600 per annum); the bottom 50% earn about 12% of total income (Gini: 0.52). In contrast, the national Gini Coefficient for all employees in the UK is 0.33; in Germany it is 0.31.\n 3. Compared to the UK, writers\u2019 earnings are lower and less skewed in Germany. This may reflect a more regulated environment for copyright contracts in Germany. It may also reflect the globalised nature of English language markets. In the UK sample, 7.2% of professional writers earned \u00a3100,000 or more from writing (mean=\u00a3188,062). In the German sample, just 1.7% of professional writers earned \u00a3100,000 (\u20ac145,000) or more. No German writers in the sample earned more than \u00a3345,000 (\u20ac500,000).\n 4. Only 20% of UK writers earn all their income from writing. 60% of professional writers need another job to survive, both in Germany and the UK. However, UK and German writers show a distinct sociological profile. German authors are prepared to enter the market as a professional author (=allocating more than 50% of their time to writing) at a much lower median income than UK authors. UK authors also appear to have a more \u201cestablishment\u201d background. UK writers\u2019 households (including partners\u2019 earnings and income from non-writing jobs) earn almost double the amount of their German counterparts (UK writers\u2019 household mean: \u00a355,620; German writers\u2019 household mean: \u20ac41,644/\u00a328,734).\n 5. Income that reflects actual use of copyright works is most skewed. For UK professional authors, the Gini Coefficient for writing income is 0.63, for total individual income of writers it is 0.51, and for total household income of writers it is 0.47. For German professional authors, the Gini Coefficient for writing income is 0.52, for total individual income it is 0.43, and for total household income it is 0.42. The distribution of income for collecting society payments (which follows actual use) is more skewed than contractual writing income (which includes risk mitigating advances). The Gini Coefficient for ALCS (UK collecting society) payments to professional writers is 0.78; for VG Wort (German collecting society) payments it is 0.67. This suggests that current copyright law may exacerbate risk.\n 6. Writers who bargain with their publishers/producers earn about twice as much as those who don\u2019t (both in Germany and the UK). Compared to the UK, disputes over moral rights (the authors\u2019 rights to be credited where their work is used and to prevent its derogatory treatment) are double as likely in Germany, reflecting perhaps the \u201cinalienable\u201d legal status of these rights in Germany.\n 7. Female writers earn considerably less than male writers. The greatest gap is for main-income writers (those who earn at least 50% of their income from writing): UK female main-income writers earn 59% of male average (mean) earnings; German female main-income writers earn 69.5% of male average (mean) earnings.\n 8. Increased exploitation and use of copyright works through the Internet has not translated into increased earnings of writers. Only 14.7% of professional UK writers and 9.2% of German writers have received specific payments for Internet uses of their works. The typical earnings of authors have deteriorated since 2000, both in the UK and Germany. \n For the purposes of this report, the authors have resisted drawing policy implications. Instead they have attempted to shape the raw data into a form that will allow multiple analyses. Emphasis has been given to providing context from statistical data held by governments, and from a comprehensive review of previous studies."}}

Content providers, such as media outlets and video subscription services, would like to ensure that their videos do not fail, startup quickly, and play without interruptions. In return for their investment in video stream quality, content providers expect less viewer abandonment, more viewer engagement, and a greater fraction of repeat viewers, resulting in greater revenues. The key question for a content provider or a CDN is whether and to what extent changes in video quality can cause changes in viewer behavior. Our work is the first to establish a causal relationship between video quality and viewer behavior, taking a step beyond purely correlational studies. To establish causality, we use QuasiExperimental Designs, a novel technique adapted from the medical and social sciences. We study the impact of video stream quality on viewer behavior in a scientific data-driven manner by using extensive traces from Akamai\u2019s streaming network that include 23 million views from 6.7 million unique viewers, who watched an aggregate of 216 million minutes of 102 thousand videos over 10 days. To our knowledge, our work is the first to provide evidence that video stream quality causally impacts viewer behavior. \n By increasing streaming quality, content providers can retain viewership and prevent viewer abandonment.

However, few attempts have been made to understand the consumption behavior of this newly emerging market because it has its own characteristics that have made other behavioral models inapplicable. In this study, we surveyed college students, who are the most active in this market, concerning their DMS subscription behavior. A modified theory of planned behavior (TPB) model was used as the framework. This new model incorporates the technology acceptance model and a new construct, the perceived service quality, into the original TPB model. Based on the survey results, the present study depicts a model that explains subscription behavior and indicates that subjective norm has the most significant effect on the intention to subscribe. Also, features that potential subscribers found important are revealed. The results provide marketing implications for DMS providers and indicate possible direction for future studies. \n Digital music service providers can influence consumer behaviour through marketing making legal downloading desirable and of high quality.", "implications": "Digital music service providers can influence consumer behaviour through marketing making legal downloading desirable and of high quality.", "results": "Digital music service providers can influence consumer behaviour through marketing making legal downloading desirable and of high quality."}}

Downloaders face moral, legal, and ethical quandaries that can be conceptualized as normative influences within the self-regulatory mechanism of social cognitive theory. The music industry hopes to eliminate illegal file sharing and to divert illegal downloaders to pay services by asserting normative influence through selective prosecutions and public information campaigns. However the deficient self-regulation of downloaders counters these efforts maintaining file sharing as a persistent habit that defies attempts to establish normative control. The present research tests and extends the social cognitive theory of downloading on a sample of college students. The expected outcomes of downloading behavior and deficient self-regulation of that behavior were found to be important determinantes of intentions to continue downloading. Consistent with social cognitive theory but in contrast to the theory of planned behavior, it was found that descriptive and prescriptive norms influenced deficient self-regulation but had no direct impact on behavioral intentions. Downloading intentions also had no direct relationship to either compact disc purchases or to subscription to online pay music services.", "implications": "", "results": ""}}

Based  on  longitudinal  qualitative  research, it  argues  that  a  radical  shift  has \noccurred in the professional values that television producers\u2019  associate with their creative work, by  focusing  on  ethical  and  professional  norms  within  factual  television  production.  By considering  the  historical  and  contemporary discourse  of  \u2018craft\u2019  within  this  area  of  creative work,  the  article  interrogates  the  nature  of  the  changes  that  have  taken  place.  The  wider significance  of  these  changes  is  also  considered,  through  an  engagement  with  theoretical concerns about the place of craft within late modernity (Sennett 2006), and with debates about the  changes  that  have  taken  place  within  the  political  economy  of  independent  television production.  The  article\u2019s  findings  have  contextual  significance  within  contemporary  debates about creative work (Hesmondhalgh & Baker, 2010).

In this study, we use the release by a biotechnology company of similar software under both proprietary and open source licenses to investigate who uses open source software and why. We find that academic users are somewhat more likely to adopt open source software than private firms. We find only modest differences in the willingness of open source users to modify or improve existing programs. And we find that users of open source software often make business decisions that seem indifferent to the norms of open source distribution. Our findings cast some doubt on the penetration of the open source ethos beyond traditional software markets. \n This is a small study in a single industry, one in which the users are not primarily computer programmers. Further research may reveal whether our conclusion is merely an artifact of our study universe, whether similar behavior exists in more traditional open-source software contexts, or whether the result is driven by the fact that users outside the central open-source community have not fully internalized the norms of open-source software.

In addition to applying the theory of planned behavior (TPB) perspective to capture behavioral intention to use pirated software, this paper considers perceived risk as a salient belief influencing attitude and intention toward using pirated software. Four perceived risk components related to the use of pirated software (performance, social, prosecution and psychological risks) have been identified, measured and tested. Data were collected through an online survey of 305 participants. The results indicate that perceived prosecution risk has an impact on intention to use pirated software, and perceived psychological risk is a strong predictor of attitude toward using pirated software. In addition, attitude and perceived behavior control contribute significantly to the intended use of pirated software. However, the proposed direct relationship between subjective norm and intention to use pirated software is not supported. Implications for research and practice are discussed. \n Despite the fact that pirated software on personal computers (PC) declined in many countries in 2007, the Business Software Alliance (BSA) (2008) claimed that piracy in emerging, fast-growing PC markets caused overall numbers to worsen and dollar losses from piracy to rise to $48 billion.

It has been common in previous analyses of moral public debates about new forms of media consumption to focus on conservative top-down hegemonic processes of reinstating order. The classic moral panic literature overemphasizes control, power and hegemony while overlooking counter-discourses. This study, on the other hand, takes such forms of symbolic resistance into account. It relies on a comparative discursive network analysis of texts produced by corporate news organizations and of blogs representing pro-piracy perspectives. It is concluded that with the blurring of the boundaries between producers and consumers of content, more and more localized moral panics that are not necessarily hegemonic are likely to be seen. Panic reactions can run not only from the top down but also from the bottom up as niche and micro media instigate their own moral panics.", "implications": "", "results": ""}}

By evaluating the empirical evidence from the music, performance and videogame markets, this article highlights a counterintuitive yet important point: Copyright piracy, while decreasing the deadweight loss in the music market, could simultaneously increase the deadweight loss in ancillary markets via the interaction between complementary goods. The deadweight loss in ancillary markets tends to become dominant if a substantial portion of relevant consumers have high valuation but low frequency in music consumption, are risk averse towards upfront payment with uncertain demand, and/or discount future value at a high rate.

This ruling was made against the backdrop of widespread patent holdup where patent owners used the threat of injunctive relief to extract royalties grossly disproportionate to the value of the patented feature to the whole product. The holdup problem, however, is not equally obvious in copyright law. \n A close examination of the copyright cases cited in eBay reveals that they are hardly compelling authorities with respect to copyright injunction. The history of copyright law appears to suggest that injunctive relief was routinely available to copyright owners who had succeeded on the merits. More remarkably, empirical evidence shows that the majority of post-eBay decisions on copyright injunctions have totally ignored the eBay decision as well as the four-factor test advocated therein. Even among the cases that did cite eBay, most courts were reluctant to withhold injunctive relief upon a finding of copyright infringement. \n This Article argues that the traditional practice of copyright law and the apparent indifference toward the eBay decision may have resulted from rational choices of judges. Copyright holdup is much less pervasive than patent holdup, as interchangeable copyrighted works abound in the marketplace, and copyright law contains built-in mechanisms to control the holdup problem. Copyright injunctions also involve a distinct set of policy concerns, such as reputational harm, fair use, statutory damages, and freedom of speech. Hence, this Article proposes several approaches to reconcile the unique concerns in copyright law and the four-factor test mandated by eBay, with a focus on three scenarios that are particularly susceptible to the holdup problem. \n This Article examines how much the eBay decision has guided, and should guide, copyright cases and it argues that the historical practice of copyright law and the apparent indifference toward the eBay decision may have resulted from rational choices of the judges.

However, there has been little clarity in copyright literature on how artists actually respond to copyright incentives: What factors motivate artists to create works? How do artists perceive the usefulness of copyright protection? Would artists continue their artistic careers in a world without copyright law? This article contains a systematic study regarding copyright incentives, based on industrial statistics and extensive interviews from the music industry in China, a virtual copyright-free environment featuring one of the highest piracy rates in the world and having forced dramatic transformation of music businesses.\n The empirical research indicates three seemingly paradoxical phenomena: While 17.9% of all the musicians in the sample referred to economic benefits as at least part of their motivations for music creation, 97.4% specifically recognized money as being important and helpful for music creation; While 56.4% alleged that copyright piracy did not affect their creative motivations, 72% agreed that copyright piracy does affect music creation; While 53.8% explicitly admitted that they had little awareness or knowledge of copyright, 92.3% indicated that the current level of copyright protection is insufficient and 71.8% suggested that copyright law should provide strong incentives for music creation.\n The empirical evidence itself provides compelling explanations for such paradoxes: Even though musicians primarily create music for music\u2019s sake, copyright law could still supply powerful incentive for music production in a way that not only caters to market demand, but also allows for broader artistic freedom. Copyright piracy that does not necessarily affect musicians\u2019 intrinsic motivations could nevertheless affect music creation in terms of the time spent on music creation, the volume of investment in music creation, and ultimately the quality of music creation. Most importantly, copyright incentives do not function as a reward that musicians consciously bargain for and chase after but as a mechanism that preserves market conditions for gifted musicians to prosper, including a decent standard of living, sufficient income to cover production costs, and maximum artistic autonomy during the creative process. \n Given that the majority of musicians appear to create music simply for music\u2019s sake, copyright law may not realize its full potential in the digital age if it is understood narrowly as a quid pro quo using economic benefits to induce creative production. This Article has demonstrated that copyright incentives\u2014although not something most musicians deliberately bargain for or chase after\u2014should be playing an important role in cultivating market conditions for the widest variety of\nmusicians to prosper, including a decent standard of living, sufficient investment to allay production costs and maximum artistic autonomy during the creative process.\nCopyright piracy that does not necessarily affect musicians\u2019 intrinsic motivations could nevertheless affect music creation in terms of the time spent on music creation, the volume of investment in music creation and ultimately the quality of music creation. \n Copyright law could supply powerful incentives for intellectual creation in a way that not only caters to market demand but also allows for maximum artistic freedom, especially for artists who create primarily for noneconomic interests.

Such negative spaces pose a puzzle for the traditional theory of IP, which holds that IP law is necessary to create incentives for innovation. \n This paper presents a study of one such negative space which has so far garnered some curiosity but little sustained attention - the world of performing magicians. This paper argues that idiosyncratic dynamics among magicians make traditional copyright, patent, and trade secret law ill-suited to protecting magicians' most valuable intellectual property. Yet, the paper further argues that the magic community has developed its own set of unique IP norms which effectively operate in law's absence. The paper details the structure of these informal norms that protect the creation, dissemination, and performance of magic tricks. The paper also discusses broader implications for IP theory, suggesting that a norm-based approach may offer a promising explanation for the puzzling persistence of some of IP's negative spaces. \n These norms include  an exclusive magic community which protects their secrets from being misappropriated from individuals not belonging to it. If individuals belonging to it do so they are subject to punishment by the community. Thus creating an incentive to keep the secrets within this exclusive community. \n Authors suggests to extend trade secret status to magic.", "implications": "Authors suggests to extend trade secret status to magic.", "results": "These norms include  an exclusive magic community which protects their secrets from being misappropriated from individuals not belonging to it.

While simple in theory, this balance has proven surprisingly difficult to achieve in practice. In part, this difficulty arises because the data available is inevitably limited, and often observational, and so the conclusions are fraught with ambiguity and uncertainty. In part, it arises because there are vested political interests that do not want an optimal copyright regime. Rather, they seek a copyright regime that maximizes their own welfare, whatever that may be.As a result, whatever data is available, and whatever uncertainty or ambiguity remains, they will twist in order to ensure that copyright serves them, rather than society as a whole. Whether due to the first problem or the second, there are also surprisingly few empirical studies of the costs and benefits associated with broadening or narrowing copyright. This study aims to help fill that gap by examining how file sharing has affected the creation and dissemination of new original\nmusic. \n In this paper, empirical evidence shows that file sharing did not reduce the creation of new hit songs. Even if we assume that file sharing caused the decline in record sales which paralleled file sharing\u2019s rise, the decline in record sales had two effects relevant to the creation of new music. First, it shifted output along the music-other margin and led to fewer new artists, as some individuals, given the lower returns available in music, decided to devote their time and creativity elsewhere. Second, it shifted output along the work-leisure margin and led to more new music from existing artists, as the lower returns led existing artists to substitute work for leisure. Because the second marginal effect outweighed the first, file sharing, even assuming that it caused the decline in record sales, led to the creation, on balance, of more new hit songs. \n Given  that  file  sharing  advances  copyright\u2019s purported  objectives, there would seem to be only one reasonable answer as to whether file sharing, at least with respect to music, should be legal under copyright law.", "implications": "Given  that  file  sharing  advances  copyright\u2019s purported  objectives, there would seem to be only one reasonable answer as to whether file sharing, at least with respect to music, should be legal under copyright law.", "results": "In this paper, empirical evidence shows that file sharing did not reduce the creation of new hit songs.

The purpose of this research is to examine the present state of downloading and how ethical orientation and attitudes towards MP3 piracy impact such activities. This paper also aims to use ethical scenarios as a way of understanding the ethical reasoning in illegal downloading.\n Design/methodology/approach \u2013 Key research questions are proposed that are related to illegal downloading. A sample of 364 university students was used to examine each research question. Statistical results are reported.\n Findings \u2013 The results clearly show that downloading continues at a high rate today driven by strong belief that it is not ethically wrong. Ethical orientation was found to be positively associated with awareness of the social cost of downloading, consequences of downloading, and ethical belief in downloading. Ethical scenarios show that ethical orientation is also associated with downloading activities and with stealing. Other results indicate that respondents believe that their peers are more prone to stealing music and downloading MP3s illegally. Fear of consequences does seem to have an impact on the propensity to download illegally.\n Practical Implications \u2013 The paper contributes to inform industry representatives that appeal to ethic or guilt are not likely to deter illegal downloading measurably. The use of punishment for downloaders may have a short-term effect but other (more positive) measures are required.\n Originality/value \u2013 No research has examined downloading MP3s in the manner developed in this paper. The paper contributes to a better understanding of consumer behavior among those who download. The results provide insight into a serious problem in the recording industry that is likely to persist in the distant future unless sound measures are developed. \n This article aims at examining how beliefs about music piracy, motives and practices as well as ethical orientations and attitudes relate to illegal downloading. More precisely, this research shows that:\n - Despite the media attention given to the consequences of illegal downloading, students do not seem to be overly concerned.\n - Ethical orientation was not associated with past or future illegal downloading activity. However, if ethical idealism can be increased, there is likely to be heightened consciousness about downloading.\n - The efficacy of using a guilt appeal as considered by the RIAA is questionable given the findings.\n - People may not identify ethics as an issue when it comes to nonphysical/tangible goods like digital files, as research on copying software seems to suggest.\n - If people suspect that they would be caught and punished, then they are less likely to download illegally.

This is particularly true for movie studios where content can be stolen and released through illegitimate digital distribution channels before, or shortly after, the legitimate release date. In response to this potential threat, movie studios have spent millions of dollars attempting to protect their content from unauthorized release, to prosecute those who might distribute or consume pirated content, and to lobby governments to strengthen anti-piracy laws.\nHowever, surprisingly, there has been very little rigorous research to analyze whether,\nand how much, movie piracy cannibalizes legitimate sales. In this paper, we analyze\nthis question in the context of pre-release movie piracy. Using data collected from a\nunique Internet file-sharing site, we find that pre-release piracy significantly reduces a\nmovie\u2019s market potential, although movies with pre-release piracy exhibit a slower sales\ndecline over time. We estimate that the net effect of pre-release piracy is approximately\na 15% reduction in box office sales.\nOur study contributes to the growing literature on piracy and digital media consumption in the Information Systems community by presenting evidence of the impact of Internet-based movie piracy, by taking a pre-release perspective to strengthen causal inference, and by differentiating the effect of pre-release movie piracy from the other types of piracy that the extant literature has previously considered. \n This study finds that prerelease pirating reduces box office income by 15%, and higher quality audio and video in a pirated film have less of an impact on box office income than lower quality counterparts.  This behaviour may act as a substitute for moviegoing or, through word of mouth, may increase sales over time; there is a possibility for prerelease pirating to act as promotion; however, it has the potential to come at the cost of cannabilisation of box office sales if the quality of the movie is low and word-of-mouth is not strong. \n This empirical information on the impact of prerelease pirating on box office sales impact can be used to justify policy and legal changes, for which creative industries previously had little evidence.", "implications": "This empirical information on the impact of prerelease pirating on box office sales impact can be used to justify policy and legal changes, for which creative industries previously had little evidence.", "results": "This study finds that prerelease pirating reduces box office income by 15%, and higher quality audio and video in a pirated film have less of an impact on box office income than lower quality counterparts.

The Pew Internet & American Life Project\u2019s \ninterest in studying artists and musicians grew out of our previous work studying internet users\u2019 consumption of music and other creative content online. Through a series of reports on music downloading and file-sharing, we have observed and documented the changing behaviors and attitudes of an American public learning to negotiate the ever-changing copyright landscape of the digital world.\n However, over the course of observing the explosive growth and persistence of peer-to-\npeer networks, and following the entertainment industry\u2019s ongoing efforts to police these activities and promote licensed digital music services, we found that there were few sources of quantitative research directed at understanding how these issues affect both musicians and the greater creative community. We found ourselves hard-pressed to answer some of the most basic questions about artists and the internet. For instance, how many artists have access to the internet? How many promote and sell their work online? How are they using the internet to develop their work, their connections to other artists, or their connections to audiences and the \nworld-at-large? How do they feel about controversies over copyright and fair use of creative material in the heyday of peer-to-peer systems like the original Napster and the current Kazaa and BitTorrent?  \n The debate about copyright in the digital era has primarily centered on the recording \nindustry\u2019s opposition to unauthorized file-sharing and downloading, a stance that has \nbeen both lauded and criticized by popular musicians. This clash over new technology \ngrows out of a long history of disputes between business and artists about the proper \nbalance between creators, the people who pay for and market creations, and consumers \nwho want access to large catalogs of digital music files and argue that there are many non-infringing uses of peer-to-peer. While music has been at the forefront of this discussion, the movie industry has also recently began suing individual downloaders. \n In our surveys between 2000 and 2003, we found growing numbers of music downloaders who said they didn\u2019t care about the copyright on the files they were acquiring. Technology firms accommodated this demand by creating and marketing an ever-widening array of devices to copy and store music files. Moreover, the growth of home broadband connections has made it progressively easier to share and download \nMP3 files. The recording industry\u2019s response to this apparent apathy towards copyright and the ease of getting free files online was to file more than 7,000 lawsuits directed against alleged file-sharers since September 2003. After the first legal actions by the RIAA, the number of people who said in our surveys that they \ndownloaded music files dropped dramatically but has since rebounded to a degree.\n Economic analysis of recorded music sales data and its relationship to music file-sharing activity is ongoing. At the same time, there is much to be learned from studying developments on the ground level. In the end, the future of any industry whose content can be digitized hinges on the creativity and innovation of artists.  \nBut there are strong concerns within the artistic community, and by prominent legal \nscholars, about the effectiveness of current copyright terms and their enforcement in the online world. Some argue that our understanding of copyright law has strayed far from its original purpose and that the internet calls for an inherently different interpretation of what constitutes copyright infringement and what qualifies as fair use of digitized works. Furthermore, many have raised concerns about the practical difficulties of the permissions process for creators and that too few new works are passing into the public domain. \n Artists are avid consumers as well as creators of online content. They often borrow from previous works and use that for inspiration for their own creativity. They represent the leading edge of media consumption online. Yet artists\u2019 perspectives and first-hand experiences with the internet \u2013 both those of musicians and the larger creative community \u2013 have rarely been examined at the national level.\n There are good reasons for this apparent gap in studying artists as consumers as well as producers. They are a notoriously difficult group to define with objective measures and are often prohibitively expensive to contact in large numbers. Musicians, in particular, are often required to travel extensively, which makes them difficult to reach with traditional telephone survey methods. \n The Pew Internet & American Life Project has undertaken several research initiatives to begin to probe these issues of how musicians and artists use the internet and how they feel about the copyright issues that have emerged in the digital age. There were three core research instruments for this study. The findings from these three surveys, while covering similar themes, are discussed in separate sections of the report in order to emphasize the important methodological \ndifferences between the samples. Additionally, each sample serves a different purpose, so we anticipate that some readers will appreciate having the data presented discretely in the sections that follow. \n The national sample of self-identified artists allowed us to ask questions of a broad, random, and representative sample of self-identified artists from around the country, to gather baseline data on internet use by a wide range of artists in the U.S. and probe their opinions on copyright issues online. However, reflecting both the well-known challenges of recruiting artists for research purposes and the conventional wisdom about the small number of career artists in the U.S., this sample was limited in its ability to include a large number of artists who rely almost exclus\nively on artistic work for their livelihood.  \n The sample of online musicians, while not representative, allowed us to reach several \nthousand respondents, including a substantial portion of career musicians (those we \ndefine as \u201cSuccess Stories\u201d and \u201cStarving Musicians\u201d in the report) who have a \nconsiderable stake in discussing both the positive and negative effects of free \ndownloading online. The musician survey, because it was administered online, also gave us a chance to ask a more thorough list of questions about the internet that was uniquely catered to musical performers and songwriters.  \n Finally, the random and nationally representative sample of American adults provided a glimpse of how the views and experiences of average consumers compare to those of the creative public. \n Main results of the study: \n None.", "implications": "None.", "results": "Main results of the study: \n None."}}

This article reports a series of experiments revealing that these debates are actually orthogonal to how most users and many creators understand intellectual property law. The most common perception of intellectual property among the American public is that intellectual property law is designed to prevent plagiarism.\n The plagiarism fallacy in intellectual property law is not an innocuous misperception. This fallacy likely helps explain pervasive illegal infringing activity on the Internet, common dismissal of copyright warnings, and other previously puzzling behavior. The received wisdom has been that the public is ethically dismissive or indifferent towards intellectual property rights. This research reveals instead that experts have failed to comprehend what the public\u2019s conception of intellectual property law actually is.\n The studies reported here uncover several additional intellectual property law findings, including that: (1) the majority of the American public views intellectual property rights as too broad and too strong, (2) knowledge of intellectual property law does not affect opinions about what the law should be, and (3) there are significant demographic and cultural divides concerning intellectual property rights. The findings as a whole raise central questions concerning the public legitimacy of intellectual property law, and consequently its ability to function as intended. \n This survey presents an original series of experiments that reveal preventing plagiarism to be the leading perceived basis for intellectual property protection in the United States.

Consistent with other studies, we find that intellectual property receives greater protection in developed economies; high-income countries have lower piracy rates. We also find that protection depends on cultural factors. Countries with an individualist culture have lower piracy rates than do countries with a collectivist culture. Piracy rates are also lower in countries that have strong institutions that enforce contracts and protect property from expropriation. These results suggest that national policies towards intellectual property reflect not only economic concerns but also national culture and institutions. \n Software piracy rates can be explained by a few economic, institutional, cultural variables. Countries with high per-capita income, a tradition of individualism, and/or strong institutions protecting contracts and property tend to have low piracy rates. Countries with high levels of education and high R&D intensity also have low piracy rates; however, these relationships are weak, at best, in regressions that account for economic development, culture , and institutional strength. \n These findings have several implications.

If they go after bootleggers, they\u2019re wasting their money.\" (Max, a bootlegger, in Vettel, 1986)\n Each year, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) releases a figure indicating the global value of pirated music. In 2000, this figure was $4.2 billion (IFPI, 2001). The IFPI argues that the actual losses suffered by the industry are not fully represented by this figure: \u2018The value of the pirate market does not indicate losses in revenue to the legitimate recording industry, which are likely to be far greater\u2019 (2001). These figures are then used in a strenuous lobbying campaign for the creation and enforcement of tougher copyright laws demanding, for example, restrictions on private copying exemptions, deterrent penalties and the dismantling of compulsory licensing provisions. This lobbying campaign is only likely to intensify in the future in response to online copying and the proliferation of CD burners. The IFPI, and its American equivalent, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) are skilful and powerful lobbyists, and past evidence suggests that policy-makers will continue to be influenced by their arguments.\n The effects of piracy are, however, more difficult to ascertain. This is for three reasons. First, the word \u2018piracy\u2019 is a blanket term covering a wide variety of activities, including counterfeiting, pirating, bootlegging, home taping, tape trading and online file sharing. All of these areas of piracy have individual characteristics that make any attempt at synthesis a hazardous and, some might say, misleading venture. Second, the world of illegal recordings is not the easiest from which to gather data. As Jeremy Phillips writes: \"Unfortunately, counterfeiters do not yet have to file annual returns to the Commission on the scale of their illegal activity, which means that the figures put forward for losses caused by counterfeiting are in danger of being subjective, hypothetical and methodologically flawed. (1999: 275)\"\n Piracy figures are often used for their rhetorical impact rather than as a reflection of reality. Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, recording industry statistics do not take into account the variety of different meanings and uses that pirated music takes in the day-to-day lives of many people. Music plays an important role in the creation of meaning in many people\u2019s lives, and the industry\u2019s concern with questions of supply (who owns these recordings?) has neglected important questions of demand (why do people want them?) (Frith, 2002). This results in a distorted impression of the effects of piracy. For example, music industry representatives lobbying for a levy on blank audio tape in the early 1980s (and again for blank digital audio tape later in the decade) argued that every blank tape sold resulted in one less official sale (Frith, 1987: 59). The small amount of non-industry sponsored research conducted into the area, however, indicates that people often use blank tapes in non-displacing activities (for example, Brown et al., 2001; Cohen, 1990).\n This article looks at one area of piracy \u2013 bootlegging \u2013 and discusses its possible effects upon the official industry. It begins by briefly differentiating bootlegging from other forms of piracy, and then provides an overview of the scale of bootlegging and the type of music fans who buy bootlegs. Following this, it discusses the possible effects of bootlegging upon the official industry. Bootlegging is a highly idiosyncratic area of piracy and the discussions here cannot necessarily be extrapolated to other spheres. However, the overall purpose of this article is to highlight the need for further research into the meanings of music piracy across a wide variety of settings in order to obtain a more realistic impression of the scale and effects of piracy in the music industry. \n Main propositions and arguments of the study: \n Policy Implications:", "implications": "Policy Implications:", "results": "Main propositions and arguments of the study: \n Policy Implications:"}}

We also characterize the demographics of P2P users, the relative popularity of the material, and how the burden on the campus network varies over time. We found that at least 51% of students living on campus engaged in P2P, at least 42% attempted to transfer copyrighted material, and the mean number of copyrighted media titles whose transfer is attempted per week was at least 6 per monitored student. Some students use P2P legally, e.g. to transfer Linux software or non-copyrighted adult material, but we found no evidence that large numbers of students use P2P for these legal purposes and not to transfer copyrighted material. Students of all genders, ages, classes and majors engaged in file sharing, to the extent that demographics were not helpful in identifying likely file-sharers so as to target interventions. This study also provides lessons for those who would use DPI technology to reduce illegal use of P2P. If given enough weeks to observe, current technology is effective at identifying users who attempt to transfer copyrighted material, provided that their traffic is identifiable as P2P. Thus, DPI can be used to estimate the extent of piracy, and to notify individuals who may be violating copyright law. However, encryption is available and can be easily activated in most P2P clients. Once turned on, encryption prevents DPI from detecting whether transferred material is copyrighted, rendering it ineffective.

The analysis highlights the role of technology in shaping the efficient standard. Discussion of several key cases illustrates the applicability of the model. \n By employing a differentiated product model, we were able to develop a threshold test for fair use that balances the benefits of wider use of original works against the possible disincentive for authors to create the works in the first place. More importantly, the model underscores the role of technology in shaping the optimal fair use standard. As the Napster case illustrates, the emergence of technologies that permit\nboth fair and infringing uses heightens the need for the court to delineate the optimal scope for fair use.", "implications": "", "results": "By employing a differentiated product model, we were able to develop a threshold test for fair use that balances the benefits of wider use of original works against the possible disincentive for authors to create the works in the first place.

Second, most studies have used the dataset from the pre-2003 methodology which only accounted for business software and did not take into account local market conditions.

From the perspective of socialization, we find differences in levels of buying based on gender, differences in levels of sharing based on age and gender, and differences in levels of use based on years of work experience.

To address this gap in the literature, this study explored the ability of Akers\u2019 social learning theory in explaining the likelihood of engaging in digital piracy. Also explored was the extent to which the social learning process mediated the impact of several noteworthy correlates of digital piracy among college students attending different universities (n=585), relying on a structural equation modeling (SEM) framework. The findings were modestly supportive of social learning theory as it may apply to digital piracy. The findings are discussed in the context of extending existing theories of crime to account for contemporary technology driven crimes, such as digital piracy. Policy implications and direction for future research are discussed. \n - The results suggest that social learning theory may account for a substantial amount of variation in the likelihood to engage in digital piracy. That is, individuals are likely to follow the social learning process that will lead them to digital piracy. The results also indicate that consistent correlates of digital piracy (e.g., gender and age) are mediated by social learning theory. By exploring crimes similar to digital piracy, scholars can shed light on existing theories, such as, but not limited to social learning theory.\n - Scholars, and the society that they serve, have much to gain by giving attention to digital crimes. Through studying digital piracy, one can gain a better understanding of crime that takes place from behind a computer terminal. This allows for theories to be critiqued, reevaluated and modified.\n - Studying digital piracy is unique by the fact that it can be used as a strategic site for unveiling criminological concepts like social learning theory as they may apply to digital crimes. Accounting for differences in how a particular theory can explain terrestrial crimes versus digital crimes may have major implications for future theory and policy development. \n From a policy implications standpoint, these results lead us to suggest that education is necessary in all regions about digital piracy.

Yet in several recent empirical studies, leading scholars have found some order in fair use case law where others have seen only chaos. Building upon these studies and new empirical research, this Article examines fair use case law through the lens of the doctrine's chronological development and concludes that in fundamental ways fair use is a different doctrine today than it was ten or twenty years ago. Specifically, the Article traces the rise to prominence of the transformative use paradigm, as adopted by the Supreme Court in Campbell v. Acuff-Rose, over the market-centered paradigm of Harper & Row v. The Nation and its progeny. The Article presents data showing that since 2005 the transformative use paradigm has come overwhelmingly to dominate fair use doctrine, bringing to fruition a shift towards the transformative use doctrine that began a decade earlier. The Article also finds a dramatic increase in defendant win rates on fair use that correlates with the courts embrace of the transformative use doctrine. In' light of these developments, adding an historical dimension to a study of fair, use case law helps to make sense of what might otherwise appear to be a disconnected series of ad hoc, case-by-case judgments and explains why current rulings might seem to contradict those regarding like cases issued when the market-centered paradigm still reigned supreme. \n Over the past 20 years, the U.S. fair use doctrine has altered fundamentally, including moving from a focus on commercial use to greater emphasis on transformative use.

This article examines why typically law-abiding people are more inclined to steal intellectual property products than more tangible, material products. The authors propose that the inclination to pay for certain types of goods and services is greater than for other types, and what distinguishes the two classes is their cost structure. They document how consumers are more or less\ninclined to pay for goods and services as a function of whether the product\u2019s cost is principally attributable to variable cost (VC) or fixed cost (FC). The authors\u2019 central thesis is that consumers (1)\nbelieve that they cause less harm if their failure to pay prevents a seller from recovering FC than if their failure to pay helps a seller recoup VC; (2) are more likely to risk not paying for a product the less harm they perceive that not paying would cause; and (3) therefore feel less obligated and are less likely to pay voluntarily for a high-FC, low-VC product than for a high-VC, low-FC product, when total cost and average cost are held constant. This research is particularly relevant in the information age, because it helps explain why consumers appear to be more inclined to risk stealing software and other intellectual property products with relatively high FC and little or no VC. It also allows for the creation of marketing remedies that do not involve further legal enforcement. \n This research shows that:\n This research may help provide alternatives to the costly enforcement associated with legal remedies by providing practical ideas for ways firms can foster greater payment intentions among consumers.

The primary objective of this research was to gather data and generate insight by establishing initial benchmarks and trends that could be used to assist policy making related to online copyright enforcement. This followed the adoption by Government of a recommendation made in the Hargreaves Review of Intellectual Property and Growth that Ofcom should not wait until its progress-reporting duties under the Digital Economy Act came into force to begin gathering trends and benchmarks related to consumption of content online.\n The research universe for this study was all adults aged 12+ in the UK. The survey used a mixed methodology approach whereby data was collected using both an online and offline sample. All material relating to the main tracking study, including key findings and full technical details, can be found at:\n http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/market-data-research/other/telecoms-research/copyright-infringement-tracker/\n The total sample achieved from the first two waves of the tracking study (covering the period May- October 2012) was 10,594, and this provided a robust and substantial base for the further statistical analysis in this report. The main aim of this analysis was to examine in more detail the complex relationship between general consumption, infringement, attitudes, and spend across six key content types of interest. There was a particular interest in understanding content infringers in more detail. The following streams of \u2018deep dive\u2019 analysis were undertaken:\n 1. Decile behavioural analysis among infringers \n This analysis segmented infringers into bands of 10% based on volume of content consumed illegally. This allows insight into the proportion of illegal content for which each decile of infringers is responsible. It is effectively a simple \u2018behavioural\u2019 segmentation based on the volume of infringement. In-depth profiling of the highest infringing decile groups (the top 20%) was then undertaken to allow greater understanding of high-volume infringers. \n 2. Attitudinal segmentations amongst infringers and non-infringers \n In addition to the decile behavioural analysis which segmented infringers on volume of illegal content consumed, we conducted an \u2018attitudinal\u2019 segmentation. The key inputs for this segmentation were motivations for infringing. Non-infringing consumers were also segmented separately according to their motivations for general online behaviour. Both the behavioural and the attitudinal segmentations can be used to help target groups of consumers based on their motivations. \n 3. Infringement of multiple content types \n The reports for the tracking study concentrated on general online behaviour and infringement per content type, and across all types. This extra layer of analysis was conducted in order to examine behaviour according to the number of types of content that were infringed i.e. are people actively infringing across multiple categories, and in what category combinations? \n 4. Spend analysis among infringers \n Additional analysis was undertaken to assess the complex relationship between infringement and spend on content. \nFurther details of the specific analysis methodologies employed can be found in the Technical Appendix at the end of this document. \n Key findings\n We conducted a series of in-depth analyses using the combined data sets from the first two waves of the Online Copyright Infringement tracking study. The purpose was to examine in more detail the complex relationship between general consumption, infringement, attitudes, and spend across six key content types. The work revealed the following:\n \nDecile analysis: A more detailed look at the Top 20% Infringers\n Infringers were segmented into 10% groups according to the overall volume of content they indicated they had accessed illegally. The main findings were as follows:\n \nInfringing segments\n As well as segmenting by volume of content infringed, we also segmented infringers by their reasons for doing it. This resulted in four distinct infringing groups:\n 1. Justifying Infringers (9% of infringers, 24% of infringed volume, 2% of total digital consumers):\n This group had the highest levels of infringement. They felt they had spent enough on content already, and this sentiment was confirmed by their high total spend offline. Most of their digital consumption was streamed and primarily related to music, though they also consumed the highest proportion of illegal books across the segments. Generally, they like to try before they buy (related to their willingness to spend) and appear to be the most receptive to good/well-priced legal alternatives.\n 2. Digital Transgressors (9% of infringers, 22% of infringed volume, 2% of total digital consumers):\n This was the youngest infringing group, with the majority in education. They had the highest levels of downloading behaviour and had higher consumption of films and TV programmes than the other high infringing group (Justifying Infringers). This group showed the least remorse about infringing material, but also had the highest fear of getting caught. In fact, they appeared to be the most receptive to receiving letters from ISPs alleging infringement.  \n 3. Free Infringers (42% of infringers, 35% of infringed volume, 10% of total digital consumers):\n This was the largest group and was chiefly defined by the fact they infringed because it was free. They paid for a low proportion of the content they consumed and had the lowest total content spend among the infringing segments. They were responsible for the high majority of illegal consumption of video games and computer software.\n 4. Ambiguous Infringers (39% of infringers, 20% of infringed volume, 9% of total digital consumers):\n This group had the lowest levels of digital consumption and the highest proportion of paid and legal content. They generally offered fewer justifications for infringing and for stopping infringing. This appeared to be linked to their lower levels of infringing activity and a lack of confidence in knowing what is legal.\n \nNon-infringing segments\n As well as segmenting the infringers, we also segmented consumers who downloaded or streamed legal content only. The four groups are summarised as follows:\n 1. Simple Streamers (34% of legal consumers, 27% of total digital consumers):\n This group was primarily defined by the fact that they only streamed content and didn\u2019t download any. This content largely comprised TV programmes and music and was generally accessed for entertainment and convenience purposes.\n 2. Simple Downloaders (17% of legal consumers , 13% of total digital consumers):\n They were defined by the fact that they only downloaded and didn\u2019t stream. They consumed less content than the other non-infringing segments, and largely downloaded books and music. Despite this, relatively they had the largest proportion of paid-for content.\n 3. Paying Consumers (34% of legal consumers, 27% of total digital consumers):\n This group paid for the majority of the content that they consumed, while also spending a lot on offline (such as physical) content.\n 4. Free Opportunists (14% of legal consumers, 11% of total digital consumers):\n 100% of this group claimed to download because it is free. They consumed a higher volume of free content than any of the other non-infringing segments.\n \nInfringement of multiple content types\n We also analysed behaviour according to the number of types of content that were infringed.\n \nSpend analysis among infringers\n Further analysis was undertaken to assess the complex relationship between infringement and spend on content, and to assess the revenue potential if infringement could be converted to legal consumption:\n Interesting policy implications can be derived by the following findings:", "implications": "Interesting policy implications can be derived by the following findings:", "results": "Key findings\n We conducted a series of in-depth analyses using the combined data sets from the first two waves of the Online Copyright Infringement tracking study.

The overarching objective of this research project was to provide Ofcom with insight into the key drivers and motivations behind the online sharing and uploading of copyrighted material in order to further their understanding of the behaviour and attitudes displayed by file sharers. Much of the available published research in this area to date has focused on downloading activity. Ofcom therefore sought to focus this qualitative research on the uploading, rather than downloading, of unauthorised material.

Intellectual property law has never protected comedians effectively against theft. Initially, jokes were virtually in the public domain, and comedians invested little in creating new ones. In the last half century, however, comedians have developed a system of IP norms. This system serves as a stand-in for formal law. It regulates issues such as authorship, ownership, transfer of rights, exceptions to informal ownership claims and the imposition of sanctions on norms violators. Under the norms system, the level of investment in original material has increased substantially. We detail these norms, which often diverge from copyright law's defaults. Our description is based on interviews with comedians, snippets of which we include throughout the paper. \n Our study has implications for intellectual property theory and policy. First, its suggests that the lack of legal protection for intellectual labor does not entail a market failure by necessity, as social norms may induce creativity. Second, it suggests that the rules governing a particular creative practice affect not only how much material is created, but also its kind. Third, we suggest that comedians' IP norms system emerged over the past half century as technological change increased the benefit of having property rights in jokes and concomitantly reduced the costs of enforcing those rights. Fourth, we note that stand-up's norms system recognizes only a limited set of forms of ownership and transfer. We suggest that the system's crude rights structure is driven by the fact that effective enforcement requires that ownership be clear to the community. Lastly, social norms offer a way to regulate creative practices that do not sit well within IP law's one-size-fits-all mold. They do so, moreover, without imposing on society the costs of disuniformity in the formal law, including legal complexity and industry-driven lobbying. \n Stand-up's norms system has both benefits and costs, which we detail in the paper. However, norms-based IP systems offer an alternative (or supplementary) cost/benefit bundle which in some cases may be superior to that of formal law alone. In stand-up's case, norms economize on enforcement costs and appear to maintain a healthy level of incentives to create alongside a greater diversity in the kinds of humor produced. A final assessment of stand-up's social norms system awaits further work. With what we currently know, we are cautiously optimistic. \n Copyright does not provide adequate protection for all forms of creative expression and thus is not always necessary.  Evolving social norms can more effectively regulate creative output in certain communities especially as regulation has a role in shaping creative output.", "implications": "Copyright does not provide adequate protection for all forms of creative expression and thus is not always necessary.

The Cuban new media landscape is supported by informal networks that blend financial and social exchanges to circulate goods, media, and currency in ways that are often illegal but are largely tolerated. Presenting two case studies of young, educated Cubans who rely on the circulation of film and television content via external hard drives for most of their media consumption, I suggest that the emphasis of much existing literature on the role of state censorship and control in Cuban new media policy overlook the everyday practices through which Cubans are regularly engaged with Latin and U.S. American popular culture. Further, informal economies have been central to everyday life in Cuba both during the height of the Soviet socialist era and in the period since the collapse of the Soviet Union that has seen a juxtaposition of some market reforms alongside centrally planned policies. In the context of nearly two decades of economic crisis, consumer shortages and a dual economy, Cuban people use both informal and state-sanctioned networks to acquire goods ranging from groceries to furnishings and domestic appliances. Understanding the informal media economy of Cuba within this broader context helps to explain how the consumption of commercial American media is largely uncontroversial within Cuban everyday life despite the fraught politics that often dominates discussions of Cuban media policy. \n The main results reported in the study:\n Policy implications reported in the study:", "implications": "Policy implications reported in the study:", "results": "The main results reported in the study:\n Policy implications reported in the study:"}}

Like the music, film, and publishing industries, it derives value from the creation of new, original works of authorship. But unlike rights holders in those more traditional creative industries, tattoo artists rarely assert formal legal rights in disputes over copying or ownership of the works they create. Instead, tattooing is governed by a set of nuanced, overlapping, and occasionally contradictory social norms enforced through informal sanctions. And in contrast to other creative communities that rely on social norms because of the unavailability of formal intellectual property protection, the tattoo industry opts for self-governance despite the comfortable fit of its creative output within the protections of the Copyright Act.\nThis Article relies on qualitative interview data drawn from more than a dozen face-to-face conversations with professionals in the tattoo industry. Based on those interviews, it offers a descriptive account of the social norms that have effectively displaced formal law within the tattoo community, provides a set of complementary cultural and economic explanations for the development of those norms, and outlines the broader implications of this research for intellectual property law and policy. \n The tattoo industry\u2019s focus on the provision of personal services, rather than the multiplication and sale of copies, might serve as a useful model for other creative industries struggling with the ubiquity of copying.", "implications": "The tattoo industry\u2019s focus on the provision of personal services, rather than the multiplication and sale of copies, might serve as a useful model for other creative industries struggling with the ubiquity of copying.", "results": "The tattoo industry\u2019s focus on the provision of personal services, rather than the multiplication and sale of copies, might serve as a useful model for other creative industries struggling with the ubiquity of copying."}}

It is rarely used as a compliment. It is rather used as an epithetic description intended to have broad explanatory power for nearly any of the many and glaring limitations that speakers and commentators contend exist in the court\u2019s body of law. The empirical basis for the argument comes from a single finding: that between 1996 and 2000 the Second and Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeals referenced legal scholarship in their decisions in trademark and copyright cases nearly four times as often as the Federal Circuit referenced legal scholarship in its decisions in patent cases. While scholars and others have relied upon this finding to assert that the Federal Circuit\u2019s performance is intellectually deficient, there are reasons to question whether that inference is proper. For instance, it stands in contrast to other observations that suggest the Federal Circuit behaves a lot like the regional circuits when it comes to its relationship to legal scholarship. \n In this study, we explore the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s use of legal scholarship in its patent, trademark, and copyright jurisprudence. We report evidence of striking differences in the use of scholarship that depend on whether a decision concerns patent, trademark, or copyright law. The Court uses scholarship in patent decisions at a rate of 28%, but uses it around twice as often in its copyright (67%) and trademark (53%) decisions. While, moreover, the rates at which the Court uses legal scholarship in its copyright and trademark decisions are some of the highest observed in the Court\u2019s entire jurisprudence, the rate at which the Court uses legal scholarship in its patent decisions is among the lowest observed. This Article discusses the significance of these observations to the empirical basis for the epithetic argument that the Federal Circuit is more insular and lacking in intellectual curiosity than other circuit courts of appeals. \n This article argues against the epithetic accusation that that Federal Circuit judges are insular and lacking in intellectual curiosity.

The sudden shutdown of the popular file hosting platform Megaupload.com on January 19, 2012 significantly (and unexpectedly) changed the availability of illegal movie downloads overnight. We compare box office revenues of movies that were available on Megaupload to those that were not pre- and post-shutdown and find that box office revenues of a majority of movies did not increase. The average effect is even negative. We show that only movies that premiere in a relatively large number of theaters benefitted from the closure of Megaupload. This is consistent with word-of-mouth effects, where online piracy can act as a mechanism to spread information about a good from consumers with low willingness to pay to consumers with high willingness to pay. This information-spreading effect of illegal downloads seems to be especially important for movies with smaller audiences, while for movies aimed at large audiences, the substitution effect between free and paid consumption weighs more heavily. \n Quite surprising in light of previous empirical work, we find that box office revenues of a majority of movies that have been available on Megaupload do not increase in response to the shutdown. Indeed, the average effect of the shutdown on a movie that had previously been available on Megaupload was negative. In more differentiated analyses, we find that only movies that were on wide release in a relatively large number of theaters (blockbusters) benefited from the unavailability of Megaupload, while the effect on more narrowly released movies was neutral and even negative for niche movies. We subject these results to a number of robustness checks to rule out alternative explanations using different specifications and additional data.\nA mechanism that can explain these prima facie counterintuitive findings is that piracy generates positive externalities through information about the quality of an experience good spilling over from pirates to (potential) legal consumers. Once it becomes significantly less easy to consume pirated content online, as was the case in our empirical setting, we would expect that at least some consumers revert to legal consumption, increasing movie revenues. At the same time, the positive externalities from pirates to legal consumers vanish, so that a number of prospective legal consumers (who would pay for watching the movie) end up being less informed about specific titles, which reduces their likelihood of going to the movies. The net effect on a specific movie\u2019s revenues then depends on how important the information externality is for the performance of this movie. Large blockbusters (i.e., wide-release movies) may be able to compensate with large advertising budgets, while word-of-mouth is likely to matter more for movies targeted at smaller audiences. \n When online piracy has very different (even opposing) effects on heterogeneous products, blanket interventions aiming at reducing the negative welfare effects are difficult to implement because externalities may affect product variety and ultimately market structures.

In terms of employment, the\nindustries contributed 3.1\u00a0% of total EU employment. As a result of gaps in data that\nare normally experienced when using national accounts and employment data from\nofficial international and statistical sources, a complete set of data was unavailable for\nstudy. These problems that arise as a result of these gaps in data are addressed in the\nstudy. The authors estimate that the effect of gaps in data understates the real\ncontribution of copyright to the European economy by 5 to 10\u00a0%.\nThe copyright industries are divided into 2 parts: 1) core copyright industries that are\nbased upon the creation, distribution, and sale of copyright products and services (for\nexample, magazines, motion pictures, recorded music, software), and 2) copyrightdependent\nindustries that would not exist without the existence of products and\nservices subject to copyright (for example, television set manufacturers, DVD player\nmanufacturers, computer manufacturers). Together they combine to form an overall\ncopyright industry that is among the most important contributor to the European\neconomy.\n This assessment of the contribution of copyright industries to the European economy\nfocuses on the turnover, value added, and employment provided by the industries.\nTurnover provides a measure of the flow of cash into the industries before costs, value\nadded shows what wealth the industries create for the economy, and employment\nindicates the extent to which individuals and society benefit through jobs creation.\nThe core and dependent copyright industries both make significant contributions but\nthe core industries are the most important to the European economy (Figure 1). \n The comparative data analysis reveals the high level of economic contribution to the European economy as well as to competing markets, providing empirical evidence in support of legal copyright protections.", "implications": "The comparative data analysis reveals the high level of economic contribution to the European economy as well as to competing markets, providing empirical evidence in support of legal copyright protections.", "results": "The comparative data analysis reveals the high level of economic contribution to the European economy as well as to competing markets, providing empirical evidence in support of legal copyright protections."}}

Today, there is the growing importance of intellectual property and copyright protection for authors and creators of literary, dramatic, musical, artistic and other intellectual works. The digital age has placed added pressure on songwriters, lyricists and composers in their ability to derive economic benefits from their intellectual creativity in the form of a copyright. Copyright laws protect and enable the creation of music by allowing authors and composers to license the control and use of their creations, and receive compensation in the form of royalty payments for their work. The PROs license, collect and distribute royalty payments for non-dramatic public performances of copyrighted musical works created and owned by its members or affiliates. In this paper, skewness and heavy tail of returns in the form of member royalty payments are estimated using the skew-normal and skew-t distributions in a parametric approach. We found strong evidence of the so-called \u2018superstar effect\u2019 in which the average royalty payment made by a PRO is still dominated by extreme outcomes, and relatively few members earned a substantial share of royalty payments from blockbuster hits that have endured over time.

In broader terms, P2P exchanges are a form of what has occasionally been labeled \u201cconsumer-to-consumer\u201d (C2C) exchange. What little work there is in business research which has examined both C2C and P2P exchange has to-date been largely anecdotal or conceptual. This paper aims to address these shortcomings.\nDesign/methodology/approach \u2013 A model of antecedents germane to the P2P phenomenon is formulated and empirically tested which includes the consumer\u2019s satisfaction with, extent of usage of, and future behavioral intentions toward P2P exchanges as the focal endogenous constructs of interest.\nFindings \u2013 The model is tested with perceptual and archival data from a survey of consumers active in one prevalent form of P2P exchange (i.e. the \u201cswapping\u201d of pirated music). The model explains significant variance in all three focal endogenous constructs.\nResearch limitations/implications \u2013 The primary limitations include the study\u2019s exploratory nature and not being able to incorporate all potentially salient constructs and variables germane to the P2P phenomenon within the context of the study reported here. Additionally, and from a sampling perspective, a more heterogeneous sample may benefit future research.\nPractical implications \u2013 The key insight emerging from the work is that the wide prevalence of P2P exchanges occurring globally between consumers has more to do with unexplored aspects of the phenomenon (such as its convenience; the \u201cconnectedness\u201d it makes consumers feel to others) and seemingly much less to do with traditional marketing mix variables.\nOriginality/value \u2013 While much has been written in the practitioner ranks and popular press about the problem of P2P exchanges, this work represents one of the first empirical studies of the antecedent drivers of the phenomenon. As is articulated in the paper\u2019s concluding sections, from a more embracing frame of reference, P2P systems and \u201cconsumer-to-consumer\u201d exchanges are not the dire threats many marketing managers believe them to be. Challenges remain, however, for marketers to determine how to best harness these powerful new systems. \n P2P systems simultaneously represent both an unprecedented threat and a tremendous opportunity for marketers in specific industries (Bloom, 2005). Thinking more clearly about both the experiential drivers (i.e. the individual\u2019s past experience with technology in general, and P2P systems more specifically) as well as salient individual-level perceptual constructs (e.g. the \u201cconvenience\u201d and \u201ccommunity connectedness\u201d P2P systems confer) will better enable marketers to successfully harness these powerful technologies in specific consumption modalities and industries\n(Denegri-Knott et al., 2006).", "implications": "P2P systems simultaneously represent both an unprecedented threat and a tremendous opportunity for marketers in specific industries (Bloom, 2005).

These rights include the right to copy, adapt, publish, communicate to the public and publicly perform the copyright material.  To balance the rights of copyright owners with the needs of the general public, the Copyright Act provides a number of exceptions to the general rules regarding infringement of copyright. The appropriate role and scope of these exceptions has been an ongoing matter for debate, particularly with the advent of digital copying (see ALRC 2013).\n Consistent with an emerging interest in better understanding the size and economic contribution of those industries which rely, to varying degrees, on copyright law, this study uses the global framework (WIPO 2003) to document the economic contribution of Australia\u2019s copyright industries over time. Due to data classification variations, the results presented in this report differ somewhat from previous estimates.\n This is the fourth copyright industries economic contribution study supported by the Australian Copyright Council (see Allen Consulting Group 2001, PwC 2008, PwC 2012).  It is important to appreciate that while the focus of this report is on the economic activity reliant to some degree on the institutional support provided by copyright law, there are a range of cultural, social and other benefits associated with the creation of copyright protected material that are not necessarily captured in the reported figures. That is, elements of copyright material - such as arts, which are seen as an important part of Australian lives - may generate benefits (e.g. cultural) that are not necessarily reflected in the market value for the goods or services (Towse 2000, p 115)\u00a0;(Australia Council 2014, p 10).\n In compiling this report it is difficult to not consider the forces that have emerged to shape Australia\u2019s copyright industries in recent years:\n In this changing and challenging environment there is a continued need for copyright industries to develop, supported by copyright law, which provides certainty and the incentive to innovate and grow. \n This study shows that Australia\u2019s copyright industries - many of which are undergoing significant change to their traditional business models as they continue to embrace digitisation - continue to be a key piece of infrastructure which support the Australian economy.

The ALRC\u2019s recommendation in favour of fair use is based predominantly on a legal analysis and did not include an economic cost-benefit analysis (CBA). From an economic perspective it is clear that they may be new disincentives to create works with the introduction of a 'fair use' provision. As a result, the core task of this analysis is to determine, based on the available evidence, whether it is likely that the economic benefits arising from secondary use will more than offset the economic loss for original local producers.

And with most on-line collections, web visitors are able to see the items while using enhanced searching and browsing capabilities to find them. This capability expands the usability of the on-line collections in ways traditional finding aids and box lists cannot match. There is a wealth of interesting and helpful material in most libraries - and as long as items are truly historic (19th Century and before) and without literary or copyright claims, the process of creating online collections is straightforward. Find the items, scan them, provide access: more primary resources on the web (though the process is a little more complicated than that). Creating an online resource for more recent historical documents (i.e., created or published less than 78 years ago) adds another large layer of difficulty to the task.\nThe Digital Scriptorium at Duke University creates on-line projects for a variety of collections, ranging from ancient papyri to 20th-Century photography. For the most part, everything that has been made available by the Scriptorium has either been out of copyright or, in the case of the photos, the library owns the copyright to the items themselves. \nThe Ad*Access project, however, presented an entirely new challenge. Ad*Access, an on-line database, gives researchers around the world images and information for more than 7,000 advertisements printed primarily in U.S. newspapers and magazines between 1911 and 1955. It is the collaborative effort of the Digital Scriptorium and the John W. Hartman Center for Sales, Advertising & Marketing History. Generously supported by the Duke Endowment \"Library 2000\" Fund, Ad*Access was created using materials in the J. Walter Thompson Company Competitive Advertisements Collection. \nThe vast majority of the advertisements chosen for this project were created and published after 1923. Clearly beyond the copyright-free zone, the library had to answer the question of whether the pursuit of copyright permission was necessary, as the project was created by an educational institution for research and study. In other words, did the project fall within fair use? \nThis article describes how that decision was made and the implications of that decision. The author includes citations from copyright law and other resources dealing with intellectual property and fair use. The author, however, is NOT a lawyer, and does not purport to offer legal advice in any way. The emphasis of the article is to describe our project's efforts in resolving the question of copyright for Ad*Access. \n The development of copyright law in relation to the Internet and image archives is still that: developing. If and when the courts are presented with test cases in this area, the clarified understanding of fair use in connection with web-based archival collections will hopefully allow an increase in the exhibits of items still within copyright. Until that point, the experience gained from the Ad*Access project assists in the consideration of other on-line exhibits to be produced by the Digital Scriptorium at Duke University. \n The ambiguity of the copyright status of the advertisements being digitised meant how to proceed with the project was unclear.\nThe advertisements in Ad*Access may never have been covered under copyright. The items may have been viewed by their creators as ephemeral and not worth registering with the Copyright Office; therefore, the pursuit of permissions for this project may not have been entirely legally necessary. The goodwill and positive responses generated by our communications with the many companies, however, was worth the time and effort of the process. The Hartman Center interacts with hundreds of companies which use the Center's resources. Engendering a negative name within this community would be counterproductive.

Until that point, the experience gained from the Ad*Access project assists in the consideration of other on-line exhibits to be produced by the Digital Scriptorium at Duke University. \n The ambiguity of the copyright status of the advertisements being digitised meant how to proceed with the project was unclear.\nThe advertisements in Ad*Access may never have been covered under copyright. The items may have been viewed by their creators as ephemeral and not worth registering with the Copyright Office; therefore, the pursuit of permissions for this project may not have been entirely legally necessary. The goodwill and positive responses generated by our communications with the many companies, however, was worth the time and effort of the process. The Hartman Center interacts with hundreds of companies which use the Center's resources. Engendering a negative name within this community would be counterproductive. Additionally, the two fundamental exclusive rights of copyright, i.e. the reproduction right and the representation right, remain operative; yet the way in which they now interact and accumulate in a networked environment is undeniably uncharted legal territory."}}

The research arose primarily from the recommendations of the Hargreaves Review which was quite explicit in pointing to orphan works as a major problem of untapped resources in the UK.  \n Within this context the aims of the study were to carry out some qualitative research in the UK\nwith organisations that had an interest in orphan works and had previously been consulted by\nIPO. The main aim was to consult on the views of interested parties and in particular discuss\nthe perceived benefits, disbenefits, and changes in use patterns from their perspective.  In parallel with this research, IPO has commissioned further research on the use of orphan works schemes and pricing issues which has been carried out by Bournemouth University.\n At the time of the research the details of potential proposals to be put forward by the Government\nfor an orphan works scheme were not known in full, but there had been consultations as part of\nthe Hargreaves Review and subsequently. Hence the results are qualified by this, and need to\nbe viewed in this context. \n The interviews with organisations in the UK showed that by and large they supported the introduction of an orphan works system. The small group that did not, considered that it would be too costly to administer, and that the costs would outweigh the benefits. There were considered to be benefits in terms of the competitiveness of businesses, especially for the smaller ones (where the cost of accessing material would be reduced, coupled with an increase in the supply) and firms in the media, TV, film and publicity sectors. Hence, there could be wider economic benefits and some stimulation of growth. The main benefits to society were considered to be increased access to materials, training and educational benefits. The disbenefits were potentially that the system could be too complex and cumbersome, and licenses could take too long to be issued. It was considered that there would be an increase in demand for orphan work material.\n The main economic benefits were considered to be increases in competitiveness, income and\nrevenue, especially for the media sector. The main benefits to society were through the increase\nin access to material which improved education and training, and the choice of services for the\npublic.\n Overseas organisations did not identify many disbenefits. The main ones were that the process\nto obtain use could take too long, and the system could be complex. The issue of legal\nchallenges was not raised as a disbenefit. The orphan works systems had increased the supply of useable materials primarily because of a reduced risk of copyright infringement, and greater certainty and confidence. There was very little difference in the perceived benefits and disbenefits of systems overseas, as compared to the potential UK system, based on the perceptions of the organisations in these countries. \n As a result of its research, the Review found that the orphan work problem results in large quantities of copyright works being effectively unavailable for use, whether for cultural or commercial purposes.

In order to test such an innovative business model, the study reported in this article carried out an experiment with 100 undergraduate students, forming five small peer-to-peer networks.

Its success has revealed a community of hackers that have attempted to circumvent the exclusive arrangement that Apple shares with AT&T for cellular telephone service. Unfortunately for Apple (and similarly situated manufacturers), intellectual property doctrines and laws do not prevent consumers from altering their products so as to circumvent relationships that manufacturers may have with others. Manufacturers inevitably lose capacity to control the product as a result of the sale of specific units. The doctrines of first sale in both patent and copyright law prevent manufacturers from controlling consumer manipulation of the object after the sale has been completed. Additionally, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act's anti-circumvention provision does not necessarily apply to prevent consumers from altering firmware within a product. Manufacturers are increasingly turning to alternatives to intellectual property to secure control over the device after the sale. One such alternative is the exclusion of warranty under Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code, for aberrant consumers.\n This article considers whether limitation of warranties may actually have the deterrence effect on consumers that manufacturers desire; said differently, the article weighs whether manufacturers can achieve their goals of preventing consumers from using their products in an unauthorized manner by removing warranty protections from the consumer. The Article presents a behavioral model based on the Triandis' model of planned behavior and enhances the model by accounting for likely and unlikely benefits and detriments. The model suggests that participants weigh the detrimental impact together with the probability and magnitude of the detriment against the beneficial impact together with the probability and magnitude of the benefit when making the decision to engage in technological piracy. Considering only half of the equation - what deterrents are likely to impact consumer behavior - the Article then reconciles the model to empirical evidence suggesting that Apple's warranty could be a stronger deterrent for consumers than civil liability.\n The data collected suggests four observations of the survey pool: (1) known sanctions reduce the preference for engaging in technology piracy; (2) persons surveyed believe they are more likely to lose a warranty than face civil liability for engaging in technological piracy; (3) a better warranty enhances the magnitude of the warranty's benefit, and therefore raises the level of deterrence to nearly equal the deterrence level of civil liability; and (4) the magnitude, probability, and deterrent impact of both deterrents can be enhanced if consumer knowledge is improved. The article concludes that manufacturers can better protect their post-sale investment in property by raising consumer awareness of their warranty's quality and by raising awareness of the consequences for using the product in a way that is outside the terms of the consumers' authorized use. \n Manufacturers can better protect their post-sale investment in property by raising consumer awareness of their warranty's quality and by raising awareness of the consequences for using the product in a way that is outside the terms of the consumers' authorized use.", "implications": "Manufacturers can better protect their post-sale investment in property by raising consumer awareness of their warranty's quality and by raising awareness of the consequences for using the product in a way that is outside the terms of the consumers' authorized use.", "results": "Manufacturers can better protect their post-sale investment in property by raising consumer awareness of their warranty's quality and by raising awareness of the consequences for using the product in a way that is outside the terms of the consumers' authorized use."}}

It also presents new evidence of the association between this form of litigation and allegations of infringement concerning pornographic films. Multi-defendant John Doe lawsuits have become the most common form of copyright litigation in several U.S. districts, and in districts such as the Northern District of Illinois, copyright litigation involving pornography accounts for more than half of new cases filed.\n This Article highlights a fundamental oversight in the extant literature on copyright trolls. Paralleling discussions in patent law, scholars addressing the troll issue in copyright have applied status-based definitions to determine who is, and is not, a troll. This Article argues that the definition should be conduct-based. Multi-defendant John Doe litigation should be counted as part of copyright trolling whenever these suits are motivated by a desire to turn litigation into an independent revenue stream. Such litigation, when initiated with the aim of turning a profit in the courthouse as opposed to seeking compensation or deterring illegal activity, reflects a kind of systematic opportunism that fits squarely within the concept of litigation trolling. This Article shows that existing status-based definitions of copyright trolls are inapt because they do not account for what is now the most widely practiced from of trolling.\n In addition to these empirical and theoretical contributions, this Article explores the features of copyright doctrine that have facilitated the recent explosion in trolling litigation in the form of litigation against John Does. In particular, it shows how statutory damages and permissive joinder make multi-defendant John Doe (MDJD) litigation possible and why allegations of infringement concerning pornographic films are particularly well-suited to this model. \n Main results of the study:\n Policy implications:", "implications": "Policy implications:", "results": "Main results of the study:\n Policy implications:"}}

This enhanced online presence has increased libraries\u2019 exposure to takedown requests from rightsholders and other concerned parties. Using survey questions and interviews, we examined academic libraries\u2019 interaction with both Digital Millennium Copyright Act (\u201cDMCA\u201d) and non-DMCA takedown notices. We found that academic libraries most commonly receive non-DMCA takedown requests that are based on non-copyright issues (such as privacy) or that target materials the library itself has placed online. In general, libraries have well- developed norms and practices in place to manage these types of requests to remove material. We also found, however, that formal DMCA notices directed to libraries have historically been rare, but that this may be changing as open access repositories hosted by libraries grow. In tracing the recent experience of academic libraries that have received DMCA takedown notices targeting material in their open access repositories, we found that libraries have not yet developed norms and practices for addressing these requests. We discuss why this might be, and suggest steps libraries, publishers, and authors can take to best manage copyright conflicts while supporting libraries\u2019 missions to preserve and provide access to knowledge. \n Although academic libraries have historically received few formal DMCA takedown requests, recent notice-sending activity, coupled with the growth of open access policies and repositories, suggests that they may receive more DMCA requests as their online offerings grow.

In addition, the growth itself might be curtailed if stakeholders take steps to limit the need to use the DMCA notice and takedown process. Educating authors about author-friendly publishing practices, continuing to push for institutional open access policies, and developing best practices for DMCA notice handling might all help.

As China's economy grows, its transition from manufacturing-based to knowledge-based production, more comprehensive laws, and more attention to enforcement have led to an increase in the number of IPR infringement cases being brought before the courts or taken up through China's administrative procedures. In this paper, the authors analyze the changing role of IPR enforcement in China and examines trends in damages awards in IPR cases in China, using a proprietary database, developed by NERA, of cases filed in China between 2002 and 2008. The authors find that, while there has been a marked increase in IPR infringement cases being brought before Chinese courts and, consequently, in the frequency of damage awards over the past decade, the damages both claimed and awarded tended to be very small compared to those in other jurisdictions and compared to the likely degree of harm caused. \n The authors find that, under the administrative systems established in China, penalties and fines\nfor IPR violations generally do not appear to provide adequate deterrence to would-be\ninfringers. Fines are so low that they appear to allow infringers to earn an adequate profit,\neven if caught and fined. Consequently, most studies suggest that fines represent only a\ntiny fraction of the estimated sales revenue lost to IPR holders.\nThe review by the authors also suggests judicial damage awards for IPR violations in China are low\ncompared to the United States and compared to the likely degree of harm caused.\nFurthermore, although the frequency of damage awards in IPR cases in China has\nincreased, the average amount awarded has not increased. However, each year there\nappear to be a few cases which involve significant damages, and these high damage\nawards appear to be occurring more frequently each year. It also appears that, while\ndamage awards tend to be low, IPR owners typically make low damages claims. \n As China becomes a major player in the world economy, it is strengthening its commitment to upholding and enforcing IPR.

We empirically study these network effects in the 16-bit home video game industry in which the dominant competitors were Nintendo and Sega. In the spirit of the new empirical IO framework, we estimate a structural econometric model assuming the data are equilibrium outcomes of the best fitting non-cooperative game in price and advertising. After controlling for other effects, we find strong evidence that network effects are asymmetric between the competitors in the home video game industry. Specifically, we find that the firm with a smaller customer network (Nintendo) has higher network strength than the firm with the larger customer base (Sega).

Under a reward system, innovators are paid for innovations directly by the government (possibly on the basis of sales), and innovations pass immediately into the public domain. Thus, reward systems engender incentives to innovate without creating the monopoly power of intellectual property rights. But a principal difficulty with rewards is the information required for their determination. We conclude in our model that intellectual property rights do not possess a fundamental social advantage over reward systems and that an optional reward system\u2014under which innovators choose between rewards and intellectual property rights\u2014is superior to intellectual\nproperty rights. \n In a regime with rewards, drugs would be far cheaper and more widely used, all computer software would be free, and electronically recorded materials would be inexpensive, arguably engendering significant increases in consumer welfare.

The analog hole refers to a perhaps - unavoidable vulnerability of most digital rights management systems. In short, because people cannot consume digital information directly, every device that performs digital content must convert the digital information into an analog signal, which is very difficult to keep from being copied.\nAlthough the analog hole has been widely decried by content providers, surprisingly little is known about fundamental aspects of how it operates. Can average users exploit the analog hole, or is this limited to sophisticated users? Does analog hole copying significantly degrade the quality of music or video? Will people pay for music that isn't a perfect digital copy? Intuitions and guesses abound, but nobody has ever conducted a study to answer these questions. We have. Although our surveys' sample sizes were too small to come to statistically significant conclusions, we did discover several interesting results including one tantalizingly specific result: What's the analog hole worth? Based on our survey, twenty-four cents. That's how much less our respondents were willing to pay for a music track when a perfect digital copy was replaced by an analog hole copy. Although our results need to be replicated on a larger scale, they suggest many conclusions that have never before been proved: people are willing to pay for less-than-perfect analog hole copies of songs; people will pay much more than half the price of a typically-priced digital music file for its degraded alternative; and even self-avowed \"pirates\" show a willingness to pay for digital music, albeit at prices well below today's market standard of ninety-nine cents a song. \n Alternative pricing models might be able to capture individuals who are willing to pay from 20 to 40\u00a0% of an illegal download.", "implications": "Alternative pricing models might be able to capture individuals who are willing to pay from 20 to 40\u00a0% of an illegal download.", "results": "Alternative pricing models might be able to capture individuals who are willing to pay from 20 to 40\u00a0% of an illegal download."}}

Previous research indicates that neutralization, a form of rationalization, can help explain software piracy intentions. However, a knowledge gap exists in our understanding of which neutralization techniques most influence software piracy intention. To address this gap, we developed a model that explains the effects of neutralization techniques on software piracy intention. We included different types of deterrents (formal sanctions, shame, and moral belief) in our model because individuals may use neutralization techniques to mitigate feelings of guilt and shame, which, subsequently, reduce the deterrent effect. Our empirical results (for 183 people surveyed) showed that appeal to higher loyalties and condemn the condemners strongly predict software piracy intentions. In addition, informal deterrents such as shame and moral beliefs are strong predictors. These findings suggest that anti-piracy efforts should involve educational intervention aimed at addressing these two neutralization techniques rather than relying on formal sanctions. \n The main results reported in the study: \n Policy implications reported in the study: \n Software development companies, educators, and anti-piracy organizations need to make a justified and convincing case that software piracy is not morally acceptable.

Using the most conservative results, 9.3% of the $14.1 billion increase in DVD sales during our study period can be attributed to increased broadband penetration. One interpretation of these results is that the difference arises from differences in the ability\nto pirate these two types of content: while Internet music piracy was easy and rampant from 2000 to 2003, Internet movie piracy was difficult and of generally low quality in this time period.

On the other side of the Atlantic, however, many European countries give creators, at least in their copyright laws, much stronger rights to attribution. At first blush it may seem that the U.S. has gotten it wrong, and the Europeans have made a better policy choice in providing to creators a right that they value. But for reasons we will explain in this Article, matters are much more complicated.\nThis Article reports a series of experiments that are the first to attempt to measure quantitatively the value of attribution to creators. In previous research, we have shown that creators of IP are subject to a \u201ccreativity effect\u201d that results in their assigning substantially higher value to their works than neoclassical economic theory predicts. The first two experiments reported in this Article suggest a way that the creativity effect may be reduced: creators are willing to sacrifice significant economic payments in favor of receiving attribution for their work. The value to creators of attribution raises the question whether U.S. IP law should be restructured to provide attribution as a creator\u2019s default right.\nThe third and most important experiment reported here casts doubt on the value of giving creators such a default right, because creators value attribution differently depending on whether the legal rule gives it to them as an initial entitlement or not. When creators are given a right to attribution as a default, they value credit four times higher than when attribution is not the default option. Our findings make clear that creators value attribution, and that the prospect of obtaining it can lead to a more efficient level of transacting. At the same time, paradoxically, our findings suggest that we should exercise caution before we restructure U.S. law, which provides no right to attribution for the vast majority of creators. Indeed, it is possible, under conditions that we will describe, that providing creators with a default right to attribution will result in less efficient transacting.\nFinally, our findings have implications for property theory which are broader than IP law or attribution rights. Our third experiment suggests that a party who enjoys a default legal right as part of her initial complement of rights will tend to treat that legal right in a fashion similar to any other form of initial entitlement, and overvalue it relative to what neoclassical theory would predict. This suggests a principle regarding how to efficiently structure default rules in any setting. All other factors being equal, an efficiently structured default rule will locate the initial legal entitlement in the party who is either less likely to overvalue the entitlement, or, if overvaluation seems inevitable regardless of where the initial entitlement is placed, is likely to overvalue it less. \n Main results:\n Policy implications:", "implications": "Policy implications:", "results": "Main results:\n Policy implications:"}}

Finally, we discuss contradictions within this group's belief systems; specifically acceptance and rejection of capitalism and state power and formal control. \n Digital piracy stems from various motivations:\n Actors within pirating communities use various forms of neutralizing thought patterns to justify illegal downloading.

However, there is not sufficient evidence that file sharing systems are responsible for the recent decline in music CD sales. Two previous studies examined micro data of sales and downloads and found mixed results regarding the connection between file sharing and CD sales (Blackburn, 2004; Oberholzer and Strumpf, 2004).\n The current essay estimated the effect of file sharing systems on music CD sales using micro data from Japan in 2004. Japan\u2019s file sharing system (\u201cWinny\u201d) is almost completely decentralized and highly anonymous compared with ones addressed in the two previous studies, thus Japanese users can download music files with less concern about lawsuits. The goal of this research is to examine the effect of file sharing on music CD sales in such an illegal-copy-friendly file sharing system.\n Based on micro data of CD sales and numbers of downloads, we found that there was very little evidence that file sharing reduces music CD sales in Japan. We controlled simultaneous bias between sales and downloads by instrumental variables, but did not find correlation between CD sales and numbers of downloads. Although there were large differences in the numbers of downloads among CD titles, these differences did not affect CD sales. We also carried out a user survey on file sharing and CD purchases with consideration to the potential bias of respondents trying to understate their illegal copying activity. This survey also showed that file sharing had very limited influence on CD purchases. \n Japanese file sharing system: \"Winny\" allows users to download illegal music files anonymously and free of charge. This study examined the extent of any correlation between the use of Winny and legitimate music CD sales in Japan. The study also examined the existence of any correlation between the file sharing activity of Japanese students and their purchase of legitimate music CDs. Despite prevalent recording industry concern, it is concluded that the use of file sharing systems has no discernible negative effect on CD music sales and specifically:\n Because the use of file sharing software does not decrease creator revenues obtained from the sale of legitimate music CDs and increases user benefit, we should say that file sharing increases the total benefit.

On the intention of softlifting, both group pressure and financial gains are significant determinants. The interaction of group pressure and financial gains is also significant: when group pressure is toward pirating software, financial gains is not a relevant factor; whereas when group pressure is toward purchasing, financial gains becomes a dominant factor in softlifting intention. A further survey (with 216 college students from two public universities in Taiwan) designed to investigate the relationship between consumer susceptibility to interpersonal influence (Bearden et al., 1989) and softlifting intention/behavior. A path analysis demonstrated that normative influence was related to softlifting intention, yet information influence effect was marginal. The effect of normative influence on softlifting behavior was mainly mediated by softlifting intention.

Industry efforts to attenuate the practice, often deterrent in nature, have largely failed. We propose that one reason for this failure is the absence of a commensurably accepted model of the social psychological foundations underlying digital piracy behaviors. A modified version of Perugini and Bagozzi's (2001) Model of Goal Directed Behavior is advocated and empirically validated across both movie and music industry settings for this purpose. The results support the theoretical and empirical efficacy of the proposed model and highlight the importance of attitudes toward the act of digital piracy, the frequency of past digital piracy behaviors, and the motivations and intentions underlying digital piracy. A normative framework is proposed with five actionable recommendations to assist digital service marketers in better addressing digital piracy. The research implications of the reported study are also presented and discussed. \n - The issue of digital piracy (DP) continues to perplex music, movie, and software service marketers. The authors argue that one reason for this is the lack of a clear understanding of the social psychological underpinnings of DP behaviors.\n - A firm understanding of the social psychological model underlying DP appears to be a prerequisite for the development of efficacious marketing communication strategies designed to persuade individuals to attenuate their DP activities.\n - This study provide a roadmap to guide service marketers in meeting this challenge by focusing on marketing persuasion strategies that specifically affect the motivations, the attitudes underlying such motivations, and the Frequency of Past Behavior in engaging in DP.\n - Overall, the results support further consideration of attitudinal explanations of goal-directed behaviors and suggest that a great deal is yet to be learned in terms of developing effective methods of persuading individuals to not engage in DP. \n First, there exists a real need for industry-wide (and perhaps even cross-industry) development and adoption of coordinated integrated marketing communication strategies. Second, the current focus on deterrent strategies appears relatively ineffective and in fact may be strengthening the will to engage in DP. So, consistent with the first recommendation, it appears judicious to begin trying to identify successful means of persuading stakeholders to not engage in DP. Third, it is important to recognize the need to simultaneously target elementary and middleschool students as part of the overall communication strategy. Fourth, some effort has to be undertaken to begin the process of managing the overall images of the involved industries as well.

Finally, the authors call on service marketing practitioners involved with the exchange of digital service products to actively pursue stronger relationships between their industry representatives and academic institutions to assist in the development of effective integrated marketing communication plans and marketing research agendas."}}

Second, common method bias and measurement error do not appear to threaten the veracity of reported results.

Based on original data with a sample of college students, we find that while students use digital media to find music new to them, social networks and traditional media continue to play a very important role in the course of exploration. We also find that digital technology is used differently by different types of music consumers and draw distinctions between peer-to-peer services and browsing, with the former more likely to be used by students from higher socio-economic backgrounds who are opinion leaders in the realm of music.

Croatia became the EU\u2019s 28th Member State on 1 July 2013. However, since not enough data for Croatia was available when the analysis was conducted in autumn 2012 and spring 2013, the study only includes the 27 pre-July 2013 Member States.\n The study covers a broad range of IP rights \u2013 trade marks, patents, designs, copyright and Geographical Indications (GIs) \u2013 and considers a variety of economic indicators, in particular Gross Domestic Product (GDP), employment, external trade and wages. It makes no policy recommendations, as this is not within its scope. Instead, it is designed to provide evidence that can be used by policymakers in their work, and to serve as a basis for raising awareness of Intellectual Property among Europe\u2019s citizens.\n The study is intended to provide results that are comparable to those obtained for the US economy. The methodology used here is therefore closely related to that used in the pioneering study\npublished in March 2012 by the Economics and Statistics Administration in the US Department of\nCommerce and the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). \n IPR-intensive industries are defined as those having an above-average use of IPR per employee.\nThe present study shows that about half of European industries can be considered IPR\u2011intensive.\nIt should be emphasised, however, that all industries use IP rights to some extent. By focusing only on the IPR-intensive industries, this study arguably understates the real contribution of IP rights to the European economy.\n Such IPR-intensive industries are shown to have generated almost 26% of all jobs in the EU during\nthe period 2008-2010, with almost 21% in trade mark-intensive industries, 12% in design-intensive\nindustries, 10% in patent-intensive industries, and smaller proportions in copyright-intensive and GI-intensive industries.6 On average over this period, 56.5 million Europeans were employed by IPR-intensive industries, out of a total employment of approximately 218 million. In addition, another 20 million jobs were generated in industries that supply goods and services to the IPR-intensive industries. Taking indirect jobs into account, the total number of IPR\u2011dependent jobs rises to just under 77 million (35.1%).\n Over the same period, IPR-intensive industries generated almost 39% of total economic activity\n(GDP) in the EU, worth \u20ac 4.7 trillion. They also accounted for most of the EU\u2019s trade with the rest of the world, with design-intensive, copyright-intensive and GI-intensive industries generating a trade surplus. IPR-intensive industries also pay significantly higher wages than other industries, with a wage premium of more than 40%. This is consistent with the fact that the value added per worker is higher in IPR-intensive industries than elsewhere in the economy.\n In addition to their direct employment contribution, IPR-intensive industries also generate employment in other, non\u2011IPR-intensive industries which supply them with goods and services as inputs to their production processes. Using the EU27 Input Output Tables, published by Eurostat, it is possible to calculate this indirect effect on employment in non\u2011IPR\u2011intensive industries. The result is summarised in table 2, which shows a breakdown by direct and indirect employment. Including the indirect jobs in the calculation implies that 35.1% of EU jobs are contributed by the IPR-intensive industries, directly and indirectly.\n Besides employment, IPR-intensive industries contribute to economic output, as measured by Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Overall, almost 39% of EU GDP is generated in IPR-intensive industries, with trade mark-intensive industries accounting for 34%, design-intensive industries for 13%, patent-intensive industries for 14% and copyright and GI-intensive industries for smaller proportions. Chapter 6 provides a more detailed breakdown of these industries\u2019 contributions to the national economies of the EU Member States.\n Comparing the results of this EU study with those for the US reveals that the two economies have a similar structure, as is to be expected given their similar level of development. However, in terms of the contribution of IPR-intensive industries, the shares in employment and GDP are somewhat higher in the EU: 26% vs. 19% for employment and 39% vs. 35% for GDP. However, in both studies, trade mark-intensive industries account for the highest shares in both employment and GDP, followed by patents and copyright in the US and by designs, patents and copyright in the EU. Similarly, the wage premiums in IPR-intensive industries compared to other industries are similar: 41% in the EU and 42% in the US, with copyright-intensive and patent intensive industries having the highest premiums on both sides of the Atlantic.\nGiven that 39% of GDP (value added) in the economy and 26% of employment is generated in IPRintensive industries, the value added per employee is higher in IPR-intensive industries than in the rest of the economy. Economic theory suggests that, all else being equal, industries in which the average worker produces more value added can be expected to pay their workers higher wages than other industries. It is therefore of relevance to examine whether this higher value added is reflected in the relative wages in the IPR\u2011intensive industries.\n Wages in IPR-intensive industries are indeed higher than in non-IPR\u2011intensive industries. The average weekly wage in IPR-intensive industries is \u20ac 715, compared with \u20ac 507 in non\u2011IPR\u2011intensive industries \u2013 a difference of 41%. This \u201cwage premium\u201d is 31% in design-intensive industries, 42% in trade mark-intensive industries, 46% in GI-intensive industries, 64% in patent-intensive industries and 69% in copyright-intensive industries.\n Finally, the role played by IPR-intensive industries in the EU\u2019s external trade is examined. The bulk of EU trade is in IPR-intensive industries. It may be somewhat surprising at first glance that such a high share of imports is IPR-intensive. This is because even industries producing commodities such as energy are IPR-intensive, while on the other hand, many non-IPR-intensive activities are also non-tradable. For that reason, 88% of EU imports consist of products of IPR-intensive industries.\n However, an even higher share of EU exports, 90% is accounted for by IPR-intensive industries. The EU as a whole had a trade deficit of approximately \u20ac174 billion, or 1.4% of GDP. Since the IPR-intensive industries as a whole account for a higher share of EU exports than EU imports, they make a positive contribution to the Union\u2019s trade position. The EU has a trade deficit in trademark-intensive and patent-intensive products, to some degree offset by trade surpluses in copyright intensive, design-intensive, and GI-intensive industries. \n It makes no policy recommendations, as this is not within its scope.

This Article challenges the conventional wisdom propounded by the U.S. and German governments, as well as Microsoft and other competitors of Google, concerning the likely economic impact of mass book-digitization projects. Originally advanced by publishing industry lobbying groups, the prevailing account of mass book-digitization projects is that they will devastate authors and publishers, just as Napster and its heirs have supposedly devastated musicians and music labels. Using the impact of GBS on the revenues and operating incomes of U.S. publishers believing themselves to be the most-affected by it, this Article finds no evidence of a negative impact upon them. To the contrary, it provides some evidence of a positive impact, and proposes further empirical research to identify the mechanisms of digitization\u2019s economic impact. \n The debate surrounding the GBS settlement is important to students, writers, researchers, and the general public, as it may decide whether a federal appellate court or even the U.S. Supreme Court allows the best research tool ever designed to survive. If the theory of Microsoft and some publishing trade associations is accepted, the courts may enjoin and destroy GBS, just as Napster was shut down a decade ago. \n The Article aims at a preliminary estimate of the economic impact of mass digitization projects, using GBS as a case in point. It finds little support for the much-discussed hypothesis of the Association of American Publishers and Google\u2019s competitors that the mass digitization of major U.S. libraries will reduce the revenues and profits of the most-affected publishers. In fact, the revenues and profits of the publishers who believe themselves to be most aggrieved by GBS, as measured by their willingness to file suit against Google for copyright infringement, increased at a faster rate after the project began, as compared to before its commencement. The rate of growth by publishers most affected by GBS is greater than the growth of the overall U.S. economy or of retail sales. Thus, the very publishers that have sued Google have seen their revenues grow faster than retail sales or the U.S. economy as a whole (measured by gross domestic product). This finding parallels some of the research that has been done since the Napster case on the economic impact of peer-to-peer file sharing on sales of recorded music. Future studies may provide a more granular estimate of the economic impact of frequent downloads or displays of pages of particular books on the sales of such books. \n The article aims at a preliminary estimate of the economic impact of mass digitization projects, using GBS as a case in point.

The three studies, including data analyses that explore the response and success rates with different types of publishers and publications and transaction costs, are then presented in detail. Anecdotes illuminate the effort required and problems encountered in trying to acquire copyright permission for open access, from the difficulty of determining copyright status and ownership and locating copyright owners to the questions, concerns, record-keeping methods, and changing contractual practices that constrain publishers' embrace of open access. The report describes how lessons learned in each study were applied in the next study and the benefits of flexible and innovative approaches to acquiring copyright permission. \n The random sample feasibility study revealed that it is indeed possible to secure permission to digitize and provide open access to books, but the work is tedious and often comes to naught. The authors learned that even determining the copyright status of a book can be difficult and time-consuming.\n The Posner project confirmed the authors belief that it is possible to secure copyright permission to digitize books and to provide open access to them on the Web. It also confirmed what they had learned in the feasibility study about how difficult and time-consuming it is to determine copyright status and to identify and locate copyright holders, particularly authors and estates. However, by dedicating personnel and adjusting our processes, they significantly reduced the cost per title for which permission was granted. Further adjustments to their workflow or refinements to their negotiation strategies could yield even greater cost savings.\n From the expense and difficulty of determining copyright status and locating the owner to the struggle to get a response from a publisher when seeking permission to digitize for scholarly use, this timely report provides a detailed account of the challenges facing libraries today. It should be of practical use to publishers and librarians alike as we try to navigate the current situation and work to improve it, through such innovations as the \u201corphaned works\u201d legislation that is currently under discussion. \n What are the stumbling blocks to digitization?

See Pub. L. No. 111-175, 124 Stat. 1218 (2010) (hereinafter \u201cSTELA\u201d). The legislation extended the term of the Section 119 satellite distant signal statutory license for another five years, modified the Section 111 cable statutory license and the Section 122 satellite local-into-local statutory license in several respects, and provided updates to account for changes resulting from the nationwide transition to digital television. STELA also directed the Register of Copyrights (hereinafter \u201cCopyright Office\u201d or \u201cOffice\u201d) to submit recommendations to Congress to achieve the phase-out and eventual repeal of Sections 111, 119, and 122, including proposals for timing and marketplace alternatives.\nIn these proceedings, the Office floated three broad alternatives to the statutory\nlicenses currently in place: (1) sublicensing; (2) collective licensing; and (3) direct licensing, and explored with stakeholders certain fundamental questions \u2013 among these, how such options might function in an open marketplace and the benefits and drawbacks of each model. The proceedings also highlighted the fact that, although the statutory licenses at issue are copyright provisions, they are intertwined with equally complex provisions of communications law and policy \u2013 the implications of which are outside the expertise of the Copyright Office and require further consideration by Congress. \n The Office supports a free market for licensing the retransmission of broadcast\ntelevision programming, finds that there are workable marketplace alternatives to the existing statutory licensing system, and suggests a phase-out approach that not only respects the rights of subscribers but also recognizes the concerns of all the affected parties. The recommendations set forth herein reflect all of these considerations.The Copyright Office hereby makes the following recommendations to effectuate a phase-out of\nthe statutory licenses:\n \u2022 Copyright owners should be permitted to develop marketplace licensing options to replace the provisions of Sections 111, 119 and 122, working with broadcasters, cable operators, satellite carriers, and other licensees, while taking into account consumer demands.\n \u2022 Business models based on sublicensing, collective licensing and/or direct licensing are largely undeveloped in the broadcast retransmission context, but they are feasible alternatives to securing the public performance rights necessary to retransmit copyrighted content.\n \u2022 The options of sublicensing, collective licensing, and direct licensing do not represent the entire universe of possibilities, are not mutually exclusive, and will not remain static. Business models may emerge that incorporate these concepts in part or in combination, and technology will continuously inform the practices of both licensors and licensees. Over time, marketplace licensing should evolve in a variety of innovative ways, subject to investment and experimentation in the marketplace.\n \u2022 The Copyright Office recommends that Congress provide a date-specific trigger for the phase-out and eventual repeal of the distant signal licenses, building in sufficient time for a measured and orderly transition period.\n \u2022 Before determining the date-specific trigger and transition period for the phase-out of the distant signal licenses, the Copyright Office recommends that Congress evaluate the concerns of stakeholders who operate with limited resources in the broadcast programming distribution chain and determine whether special consideration is advisable.\n \u2022 During the transition period, the Section 111, 119, and 122 statutory licenses should not apply to any broadcast station that has obtained the rights to retransmit all of the content carried on its signal, provided that the local broadcast station forgoes its mandatory carriage rights under the United States Copyright Office STELA \u00a7 302 REPORT 140 must-carry and carry-one carry-all provisions of the Communications Act. This \u201cstation-bystation\u201d option would apply to all broadcast stations, including those in distant markets.

Indeed, U.S. copyright law derives\nfundamentally from the principle that authors\u2019 interests are inseparable from the broader public interest. While \u201c[t]he immediate effect of our copyright law is to secure a fair return for an \u2018author\u2019s\u2019 creative labor,\u201d the \u201cultimate aim is . . . to stimulate artistic creativity for the general public good.\u201d Accordingly, to the extent that the current copyright system is not working effectively for authors \u2013 or is disfavoring a discrete class of authors \u2013 Congress should be concerned.\n In the framework of the resale royalty discussions, the authors at issue are certain visual\nartists, including painters, illustrators, sculptors, and photographers (hereinafter \u201cvisual artists\u201d or \u201cartists\u201d). Based on the information and comments provided during the preparation of this report, as well as the Office\u2019s independent research, the Office agrees that, under the current legal system, visual artists are uniquely limited in their ability to fully benefit from the success of their works over time. The distinctive nature of the creation and marketing of visual art has not changed since the Office\u2019s main study on the topic, published in 1992. At the same time, recent developments \u2013 including in particular the adoption of resale royalty laws by more than thirty additional countries since the Office\u2019s prior report \u2013 would seem to warrant renewed consideration of the issue.\n In general, visual artists do not share in the long-term financial success of their works.\nInstead, the financial gains from the resale of their works inure primarily to third parties such as auction houses, collectors, and art galleries. Moreover, the income typically available to other authors through reproduction and derivative uses of their works is more limited for artists. Although the Internet has provided artists with greater opportunities to exploit derivative images and/or sell mass-produced copies of their works, stakeholders agree that \u201cfor most visual artists . . . the amounts involved in reproduction or representation are generally insignificant.\u201d Indeed, it appears to be common ground that reproduction rights represent a \u201cvery minor aspect of [most artists\u2019] careers\u201d and that the first sale of a work is \u201cthe main or exclusive source of income for almost all American artists.\u201d\n The Copyright Office agrees that these factors place many visual artists at a material\ndisadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis other authors, and therefore the Office supports congressional\nconsideration of a resale royalty right, or droit de suite,8 which would give artists a percentage of the amount paid for a work each time it is resold by another party. A large and growing number of countries around the world \u2013 more than seventy in total \u2013 now follow that approach. Other potential responses might include the facilitation of voluntary initiatives among stakeholders in the art market, amending the copyright law to give artists a continuing economic interest in their works through, for example, greater interests in public display or commercial rental rights, and increased federal grants for visual art programs. \n That said, an \u201cinformation problem\u201d in the art market \u2013 something that many have acknowledged \u2013 does present certain challenges. Any assessment of the treatment of visual artists under U.S. law suffers from a lack of independently verifiable data about the operation of the art market and a resulting difficulty in determining whether a resale royalty in particular would truly operate to place artists on equal footing with other authors. At the same time, the Office recognizes that many of the arguments against the right are overblown. Moreover, according to the most recent studies, a number of the adverse consequences that this Office\u2019s previous report predicted might follow from implementation of the right have not materialized in countries that have adopted droit de suite since that time. Accordingly, the Office finds no clear impediment to implementation of a resale royalty right in the United States and supports the right as one alternative to address the disparity in treatment of artists under the copyright law.]] \n \u2022 Although visual artists possess the same exclusive rights under copyright law as other\nauthors, they are disadvantaged as a practical matter by certain factors endemic to the\ncreation of works that are produced in singular form (or in very limited copies) and are\nvalued for their scarcity. There are sound policy reasons to address this inequity,\nincluding the constitutionally-rooted objective to incentivize the creation and\ndissemination of artistic works.\n \u2022 While a resale royalty could be one of many factors affecting the location of auctions and other art sales, there is no evidence to conclusively establish that it would harm the U.S.visual art market.

Our licensing system is founded on a view that the music marketplace requires a unique level of government regulation, much of it reflected in statutory licensing provisions of the Copyright Act. The Copyright Office believes that the time is ripe to question the existing paradigm for the licensing of musical works and sound recordings and consider meaningful change.\n There is a widespread perception that our licensing system is broken. Songwriters and recording artists are concerned that they cannot make a living under the existing structure, which raises serious and systemic concerns for the future. Music publishers and performance rights organizations are frustrated that so much of their licensing activity is subject to government control, so they are constrained in the marketplace. Record labels and digital services complain that the licensing process is burdensome and inefficient, making it difficult to innovate.\n While there is general consensus that the system needs attention, there is less agreement as to what should be done. In this report, after reviewing the existing framework and stakeholders\u2019 views, the Copyright Office offers a series of guiding principles and preliminary recommendations for change. The Office\u2019s proposals are meant to be contemplated together, rather than individually. With this approach, the Office seeks to present a series of balanced tradeoffs among the interested parties to create a fairer, more efficient, and more rational system for all. \n The Copyright Office appreciates and agrees with the four grounding principles that were articulated by many during the course of this study, as discussed above.

This Report addresses two circumstances in which the accomplishment of that goal may be hindered under the current law due to practical obstacles preventing good faith actors from securing permission to make productive uses of copyrighted works.  First, with respect to orphan works, referred to as 'perhaps the single greatest impediment to creating new works,' a user's ability to seek permission or to negotiate licensing terms is compromised by the fact that, despite his or her diligent efforts, the user cannot identify or locate the copyright owner. Second, in the case of mass digitization \u2013 which involves making reproductions of many works, as well as possible efforts to make the works publicly accessible \u2013 obtaining permission is essentially impossible, not necessarily because of a lack of identifying information or the inability to contact the copyright owner, but because of the sheer number of individual permissions required. \n After reviewing stakeholder responses and international systems, the Copyright Office recommends two separate solutions for mass digitization and orphan works.  Due to the widespread problem of receiving permission for orphan work use, the Copyright Office recommends limiting liability on infringement for orphan works after diligent search.  For mass digitization, the issue centres on market efficiency rather than lack of information.  Thus the Copyright Office proposes legislative reform (with regulatory flexibility) based on extended collective licensing. \n The proposed orphan works legislative framework would do the following:", "implications": "The proposed orphan works legislative framework would do the following:", "results": "After reviewing stakeholder responses and international systems, the Copyright Office recommends two separate solutions for mass digitization and orphan works.

This doctrine states that works created by employees within the scope of their employment result in the employer owning the copyright. One key determination in this analysis is whether the hired party is an employee or independent contractor. In 1989, the U.S. Supreme Court, in CCNV v. Reid, answered the question of how employees are distinguished from independent contractors by setting forth a list of factors courts should consider. Unfortunately, the Supreme Court did not give further guidance on how to balance these factors. Three years later, in 1992, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit decided Aymes v. Bonelli and noted that not all factors are equally weighted and that five of the factors would \u201cbe significant in virtually every situation.\u201d This analysis was supported by looking at all the work made for hire cases decided in the three year period since Reid \u2013 six cases in total. This Article expands in both scope and time what the Second Circuit did in Aymes and systematically analyzes how courts have utilized the factors in the twenty-five years since Reid. In particular, this study has identified the universe of cases where the courts have decided whether a hired party was an employee or independent contractor and uses the data from these cases to describe what factors appear to be the most and least important in reaching these conclusions. Based on the results of this study, this Article proposes a continuum of importance, which graphically illustrates the relative importance of each factor. \n In the event Congress has the opportunity to revisit the work made for hire doctrine and believes predictability and certainty are still valuable goals vis \u00e0 vis copyright ownership, then perhaps Congress could provide more guidance as to what constitutes an employer-employee relationship by recognizing these factors as existing in tiers.", "implications": "In the event Congress has the opportunity to revisit the work made for hire doctrine and believes predictability and certainty are still valuable goals vis \u00e0 vis copyright ownership, then perhaps Congress could provide more guidance as to what constitutes an employer-employee relationship by recognizing these factors as existing in tiers.", "results": "In the event Congress has the opportunity to revisit the work made for hire doctrine and believes predictability and certainty are still valuable goals vis \u00e0 vis copyright ownership, then perhaps Congress could provide more guidance as to what constitutes an employer-employee relationship by recognizing these factors as existing in tiers."}}

The article ends with some reflections on alternative business models for provision of creative works. \n - Copyright is a second-best solution to intellectual property provision. Perhaps the ultimate saving grace is that the same technological advances that are making digital content inexpensive to copy are also helping to reduce the fixed cost of content creation.

Works existing in analogue form can now be easily digitised and therefore reused for different purposes and by different users. Industries, such as publishers, producers, broadcasters or information service providers are taking advantage of information technology by reusing analogue material in different ways. For instance, analogue material can be republished on the Internet websites, released on DVD or new compilations of old material can be produced. Also different cultural institutions can take advantage of the new opportunities opened up by digital technology. Museums, archives and libraries are involved in the digitisation of their collections of cultural and scientific material. In the case of the activities carried out by cultural institutions, the purpose of digitisation is often not only to preserve cultural and scientific material but also to provide users with access to their resources, including access online. To promote digitisation, online accessibility and preservation of digital material of cultural institutions, the European Commission launched the \"i2010: Digital Libraries\" programme1 in September 2005. Before digitising and further reutilising material that is still in copyright, the prospective user must often obtain consent from the copyright owner. The problem appears when it is impossible to find or locate right holders or when right holders remain unknown. This is the problem of so called \u2018orphan works\u2019. Where it is impossible to get suitable permission from the owner, digitisation and further exploitation of the material might not take place. Such a situation is to the detriment not only of the user, but generally speaking, of the public, as no-one profits from cultural material left unexploited due to its orphan status.   Discussions on how to deal with orphan works are currently being undertaken by stakeholders and cultural and collective management institutions at different levels and scopes. Some of them have been initiated by the stakeholders themselves, others by the European Commission or by Member States. Generally speaking, the aim of these discussions is to find a solution to facilitate the use of orphan material without prejudice to copyright. The eventual solution should provide legal certainty both to users and right holders, should the right holders reappear after the use of orphan works was made without their explicit consent.   The objective of this report is to give a general overview of the situation of orphan works in the European Union. The report describes possible legislative solutions to the issue, as well as main actions that are currently underway in this field.", "implications": "", "results": ""}}

The phenomenon of open source software development shows that users program to solve their own as well as shared technical problems, and freely reveal their innovations without appropriating private returns from selling the software. In this paper, we propose that open source software development is an exemplar of a compound \u201cprivate-collective\u201d model of innovation that contains elements of both the private investment and the collective action models and can offer society the \u201cbest of both worlds\u201d under many conditions. We describe a new set of research questions this model raises for scholars in organization science.

In the recently released Communications \"Europeana \u2013 next steps\"  and \"Copyright in the knowledge economy\"  the Commission indicates that it will examine the orphan works problem in an impact assessment, which will explore a variety of approaches to facilitate the digitisation and dissemination of such works.\n It is hard to establish reliable figures on the amount of orphan works, because at the moment there is no easy way to establish that a work is orphan. Hence, very little systematic research has been done and hardly any empirical data has been available about problems related to orphan works. The orphan works issue has been extensively analysed by the Copyright Subgroup within the High Level Expert Group on Digital Libraries, appointed by the Commission in 2006. A consolidated Final Report was published in December 2009.\n Therefore, as a complement to the past work and in order to gather as much empirical evidence as possible on orphan works in terms of 1) the dimension of the problem and 2) of the time and resources involved in efforts for clearing rights, the Commission carried out a fact finding mission in December 2009. A request for information was sent to 17 representatives of cultural institutions who had previously been involved with digitisation of cultural materials (such as British Library, Institut National de l'Audiovisuel and Deutsche Nationalbibliothek). The letter was also distributed via mailing lists of library organisations such as the LIBER and CENL. Attached to this assessment is a list of the recipients. All together the Commission received 22 responses. Several of them included comprehensive tables and statistics about key issues reflecting the above questions and a description of concrete situations. Considering the difficulties in demonstrating the dimension of orphan works in concrete figures within digitisation projects around Europe, the received materials have been useful to illustrate the difficulties faced by cultural institutions when trying to clear the rights involved in the digitisation and online accessibility of protected content in their collections, particularly orphan works.\n This analysis gathers the experiences of this fact finding mission as well as the figures included in other governmental fact finding initiatives, such as the US Report on Orphan Works and the Gower's Review, both of 2006, and the more recent Digital Britain, \u00a9 The way ahead and In from the Cold reports, all of 2009. The results of the ACE Study (European Film Archives association) of 2010 about the amount of orphan works in film archives across Europe is also reflected in this paper. The status of national initiatives regarding solutions to the orphan works issue in various Member States was examined in February 2008. Some EU countries had already taken steps to develop a specific solution for the orphan works issue. The most advanced in this area are Denmark and Hungary. Denmark had chosen to strengthen their system of extended collective licences widely applied also in the rest of the Nordic countries, while Hungary opted for a centrally-granted non-exclusive licence solution. In addition, several Member States such as the UK, Germany and France are considering solutions varying from limitations to the exclusive rights of the authors, to the use of mandatory collective licensing, or so called extended collective licensing.\nIn order to solve this issue in a coherent way for all the EU, steps to propose legislation in this field need to be taken urgently. \n The results of the study showed that there were a high number of Orphan Works across the Cultural Institutions. Orphan works form a significant part of any digitisation project and the survey shows high percentages of orphan works for almost all categories of works, especially among photographs, and audiovisual materials. \nThe study also found that transaction costs for clearing rights were expensive. Important information was collected also about the experiences as well as concrete costs involved in the rights clearance processes of cultural institutions. This information shows that rights clearance is costly and cumbersome for these institutions. In fact, the amount of time and effort to obtain licenses to digitise works has overwhelmed many of them. Data shows that the older the work and the less economic value it has, the more it costs to clear rights to use it. \n A large number of digitisation projects has been analysed for this report, and the findings indicate clearly that there are considerable amounts of orphan works in collections of cultural institutions around Europe. This assessment should not, however, be considered as a comprehensive analysis of the situation concerning orphan works because extensive research has not been carried out in this topic.\nThe figures in the report only illustrate the dimension of the problem without implying any particular policy decisions.

This paper examines the effects of authorized and unauthorized web distribution on television viewing between 2005 and 2007 using a survey of Penn students on their tendencies to watch television series on television as well as on the web. The results provide a glimpse of the way young, Internet-connected people use YouTube and related sites. While I find some evidence of substitution of web viewing for conventional television viewing, time spent viewing programming on the web - 4 hours per week - far exceeds the reduction in weekly traditional television viewing of about 25 minutes. Overall time spent on network-controlled viewing (television plus network websites) increased by 1.5 hours per week. \n - The empirical literature on file sharing in music and movies has, for the most part, found depressing effects of web distribution on legal sales. This study too finds significant depressing effects of web distribution on conventional television viewing, but it also documents largely offsetting positive relationships, reflecting complementarity. \n - Overall, conventional television viewing is reduced slightly in this sample, while overall viewing of network programming rises substantially. Hours spent viewing television programming overall nearly double with web distribution. While conventional television viewing falls by about 5 percent, this is more than offset by increases in time spent viewing network-authorized web programming.\n - The networks\u2019 own web distribution has smaller but similar effects as the \nunauthorized distribution on conventional television viewing. Of course, in the network efforts, the network broadcasts advertising, so the loss the traditional viewing is at least partially offset by online ad revenue. \n The authors recommend wider-scale sampling for determining typical effects of web distribution of television programming on television viewing - the population selected for this research (media users on a college campus) is adequate for the study given its intense computer use, but it's not representative of the US population generally.", "implications": "The authors recommend wider-scale sampling for determining typical effects of web distribution of television programming on television viewing - the population selected for this research (media users on a college campus) is adequate for the study given its intense computer use, but it's not representative of the US population generally.", "results": "- The empirical literature on file sharing in music and movies has, for the most part, found depressing effects of web distribution on legal sales.

The iTunes Music Store has grown quickly since its appearance in 2003, and digital music now accounts for a third of US recorded music sales. Using two new surveys of University of Pennsylvania undergraduates in 2009 and 2010, we ask how music file sharing and sales displacement operate in the iTunes era, when the alternative to file sharing is purchasing individual songs, rather than entire albums. We find large amounts of file sharing in this population. Respondents have more stolen than paid music, but the music obtained via file sharing is, for the most part, low-valuation music which the respondents would likely not have purchased. The rate of sales displacement implied by the relationship between stolen and purchased music across respondents in both samples is between \u22120.15 and \u22120.3. That is, an additional song stolen reduces paid consumption by between a third and a sixth of song. Perhaps surprisingly, this is about the same as the CD sales displacement rate found for the pre-iTunes era using a similar empirical approach on a similar study population. \n Ensuring a sufficient revenue to attract production in the first place is necessary in order to make possible the benefit to consumers which results from file sharing.", "implications": "Ensuring a sufficient revenue to attract production in the first place is necessary in order to make possible the benefit to consumers which results from file sharing.", "results": "Ensuring a sufficient revenue to attract production in the first place is necessary in order to make possible the benefit to consumers which results from file sharing."}}

Data were collected from 350 teenagers in Northern Taiwan through questionnaire interviews conducted in city centers where teenagers gather. The results of partial least squares (PLS) analyses reconfirm the explanatory power of the TPB model with regard to the pop music illegal downloading behavior. However, it is interesting to note that the intention to illegally download music does not have a significant influence on the intention to buy music. This finding contradicts our common intuitions. Further analyses also reveal that idolatry moderates the relationship between the intention to illegally download music and the intention to buy music. For teenagers with high idolatry, a higher music downloading intention results in a lower buying intention. One possible explanation is the price of music CDs.

Anticipated guilt was a significant, negative predictor of intentions to download among those who engaged in illegal downloading in the previous 6 months, but not among those did not. General anticipated emotions predicted intentions to download among the whole sample. Both theoretical and practical implications are discussed. \n This article is an attempt to examine the emotional aspect of illegal file sharing by examining the influence of guilt, a moral emotion, on intentions to engage in illegal digital downloading or digital piracy. It examines the moderating role of past downloading behavior on the relationship between anticipated guilt/emotions and intentions, which has not been examined in the illegal downloading context, by casting light on the means and standard deviations of guilt and general emotions among those who engaged in digital piracy and among those who rarely or never downloaded on both the emotional and cognitive variables. More specifically, this article shows that: \n - Future research concerning illegal downloading, or consumer ethics research, may benefit from including emotional determinants of intentions. \n - Anti-piracy campaigns can use emotional appeals, in addition to addressing attitudes, norms, and perceived behavioral control among the potential target audience.\n - Although it might be difficult to lower the magnitude of anticipated general emotions, anti-piracy efforts can point out the positive emotions that one might experience by not engaging in illegal downloading or can enhance the audience\u2019s positive emotions by providing them with alternatives, for example, low-cost legal copies of the digital content.\n - The inclusion of anticipated guilt is especially relevant for understanding and designing future anti-piracy efforts given that the recording, motion picture, and software industries frequently focus on the moral and ethical aspect of illegal downloading through a peer-to-peer network.", "implications": "- Future research concerning illegal downloading, or consumer ethics research, may benefit from including emotional determinants of intentions. \n - Anti-piracy campaigns can use emotional appeals, in addition to addressing attitudes, norms, and perceived behavioral control among the potential target audience.\n - Although it might be difficult to lower the magnitude of anticipated general emotions, anti-piracy efforts can point out the positive emotions that one might experience by not engaging in illegal downloading or can enhance the audience\u2019s positive emotions by providing them with alternatives, for example, low-cost legal copies of the digital content.\n - The inclusion of anticipated guilt is especially relevant for understanding and designing future anti-piracy efforts given that the recording, motion picture, and software industries frequently focus on the moral and ethical aspect of illegal downloading through a peer-to-peer network.", "results": "This article is an attempt to examine the emotional aspect of illegal file sharing by examining the influence of guilt, a moral emotion, on intentions to engage in illegal digital downloading or digital piracy.

The paper is not intended to be a full literature survey, but rather attempts to identify the main areas that have been studied, and to offer an overview of what the literature says by means of an analysis of representative publications. The principal objective is to attempt to provide guidance to economists interested in undertaking empirical research on the economics of copyright, particularly in developing countries and countries with economies in transition. I shall attempt to provide an identification of areas for further research and suitable methodological approaches that could be followed by economists, especially in developing countries and countries with economies in transition, to study the economics of copyright empirically. To that end, the paper will address the following general topics: (1) papers dealing specifically with supply side effects (earnings from copyright royalties, the effect of copyright law on creativity, collective management of copyright); (2) papers dealing specifically with demand side effects (willingness to pay by consumers of copyright products, copyright infringement or piracy); (3) papers concerning emerging mechanisms for exercising rights over protected works. The paper concludes with a section that addresses directly the issue of copyright for developing countries. \n This paper reviews the empirical literature on the use of appropriability strategies, including the determinants of the propensity to patent, with a view to highlighting the main findings.

It is interesting that economists themselves have not put the issue of contracts into the forefront of the economics of copyright, since certainly the study of contracts and the incentives that they create is of primordial interest to economists generally.\n This Article reviews the scant economics literature that does deal with the relationships between the legal institution of copyright and the contracts that are then written along the value chain.

Our theoretical and empirical results imply that lax anti-piracy policies would make software producers better off (i.e., higher software sales because of network effects) in countries whose income inequality is moderate, but worse off in countries whose income inequality is severe.

Two characteristics of these communities set them apart from traditional online message-based communities such as online forums. First, users have no social ties before joining the community. Second, there is little or no \"verbal\" communication between users. This research investigates the structure and dynamics of online sharing communities using data collected from an IRC music channel from 2001 to 2006, covering all five years of the post-Napster age. We have collected more than three hundred million individual activities, capturing 0.05% of the global music sharing volume. We find that sharers are an essential part of the community and their activities have a dominant impact on the growth of the community. By contrast, free riders have two opposite impacts on sharer retention. More free riders in number make it more likely for a sharer to keep sharing, while more free rider activities discourage sharers from contributing. That is, the existence of free riders, despite the congestion caused by their download activities, does to some degree stabilize the community. Most previous literature examines the online community only from the aggregate level. Our study, nevertheless, distinguish the influence and behavior of different members in the community. Instead of paying only attention to the total number of users, our results suggest that understanding the impact of their core members is critical in investigating the dynamics and the sustainability of online sharing communities. \n This study has several managerial implications:", "implications": "This study has several managerial implications:", "results": "This study has several managerial implications:"}}

Evidence is found suggesting that IRC has lower maximal social welfare than FLC does. This difference can be explained by the way copyright duration is determined. Copyright duration represents the balance between encouraging creation and reducing restrictions on the consumption of information products. Under FLC, copyright duration is chosen directly by legislation; under IRC, it is induced indirectly through a copyright fee. However, the imposition of a copyright fee distorts the behavior of creators and thus decreases social welfare. \n This study models the market of information products under FLC and under IRC. The models\ndescribe competition in both creation and production of information products and capture the\ndecisions on pricing, number of first-copy products, and entry of creators.

Meanwhile, database creators have been seeking legal protection for their data, such as the European Union's Database Directive. The legislative development shows that there is significant difficulty in finding the right balance between protecting the incentives of creating publicly accessible databases (including semistructured Web sites) and preserving adequate access to factual data for value-creating activities. We address this issue using an extended spatial competition model that explicitly considers licensing provisions and inefficiencies in policy administration. The results show that, depending on the cost level of database creation, the degree of differentiation of the reuser database, and the efficiency of policy administration, there are different socially beneficial policy choices, such as protecting a legal monopoly, encouraging competition via compulsory licensing, discouraging voluntary licensing, or even allowing free riding. With the appropriate policy in place, both the creators and the reusers should focus on innovation that can increase the variety of databases and create value from database contents. \n The results show that, depending on the cost level of database creation, the degree of differentiation of the reuser database, and the efficiency of policy administration, there are different socially beneficial policy choices, such as protecting a legal monopoly, encouraging competition via compulsory licensing, discouraging voluntary licensing, or even allowing free riding. With the appropriate policy in place, both the creators and the reusers should focus on innovation that can increase the variety of databases and create value from database contents. \n New database regulation will impact all stakeholders in the information economy, in which database creators,  data reusers, and the consumers of the creator or reuser database products are the primary ones. One of the important factors to consider in policy formulation is the financial interests in database contents. A creator who invested in creating a database is interested in recouping the investment using the revenues that the database helps to generate. The revenues may be reduced when a free-riding reuser creates a competing database by extracting the contents from the creator's database. Thus, creators would like to have certain means of protecting the contents in their databases. Without adequate protection, the incentives of creating  such databases could diminish. On the other hand, overprotection can cause under-utilization of information and make downstream value-added data reuse costly or even impossible. It is important, and often rather difficult, to formulate a policy that reasonably balances the two interests.", "implications": "New database regulation will impact all stakeholders in the information economy, in which database creators,  data reusers, and the consumers of the creator or reuser database products are the primary ones.
